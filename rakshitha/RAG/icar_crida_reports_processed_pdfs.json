Mobile   98489 24254 Preface It is my esteemed pleasure to present the 2022 annual report of ICAR CRIDA. During this year, the institute has achieved remarkable progress in the research and development and generation of technology related to climate change and rainfed agriculture, positioning itself as a leading scientific institute in India in devising strategies to tackle the climate related challenges faced by farmers in rainfed regions. This report highlights the notable accomplishments in research, technology development, and other activities. ICAR CRIDA has made remarkable advancements in cropping system research in drylands and has provided recommendations on the appropriate technologies for dryland farmers. The institute has particularly focused on assessment of soil quality and the development of indices for predominant rainfed areas. CRIDA has also made significant contributions in conservation agriculture practices, including the use of novel soil amendments and in situ moisture conservation strategies. Additionally, the institute has developed innovative nutrient management strategies that have the potential to improve crop yields in these areas. The institute has focused on several key areas, including abiotic stress management, basic areas of photosynthesis, mapping population and genetic enhancement for drought tolerance in maize and important socio economic and policy studies. Through its efforts, ICAR CRIDA has become a leading institution in the field of dryland agricultural research, and its contributions have helped to increase the resilience of farming communities in these regions and to improve their standard of living. Various programmes like National Girl Child day, International Women s Day, Poshan vatika along training on different livelihood generation activities for farm women were conducted by the Institute for women in agriculture. During the year, 15 scientists, 5 technical and 2 finance staff participated in various training programmes as a part of human resource development. The scientists of the institute participated in about 100 different Conferences, Meetings, Workshops, Seminars and Symposia. The Institute received three awards and sixteen scientists received awards, fellowships and recognitions from national academies, professional societies and other institutions. Ninety seven research articles  international national peer reviewed journals , other publications books, reports, bulletins, training manuals, brochures, including 40 book chapters were published. ICAR CRIDA continues to work in collaboration with Ministries and Departments of the Government of India, State Governments, State Agricultural Universities, Non Governmental Organizations and Private Industry for providing technological solutions to dryland agriculture in the country. I place on record my gratitude to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for its continued support and guidance. I appreciate the work put in by the annual report committee for bringing out this report.

Resilient Agriculture  NICRA  and externally funded projects. There were also outreach programmes such as Farmer First Programme  FFP , Schedule Caste Sub Programme  SCSP , Tribal Sub Plan  TSP  and CRIDA KVK activities in Ranga Reddy district, Telangana. The achievements of all the above activities and others are briefly highlighted below. Resource characterization   The district based contingency plans  DACP  were prepared for 648 districts in the country and hosted on ICAR DAC websites  http   agricoop. nic.in acp. html, http   www.icar crida.res.in   and circulated to all state agriculture departments. A total of 514 DACPs have been updated till now.   Groundwater recharge prospect was estimated qualitatively at the district level based on the weekly rainfall of kharif 2022. A medium to normal groundwater recharge prospects was estimated in about 452 districts and an extremely low to very low in about 135 districts out of the 675 districts analysed.   Based on the quantification of the changes in annual rainfall across India for two time periods  1961 1990 and 1991 2020  made from grid  based rainfall information, an increase in rainfall was observed in eastern and western parts of India. Parts of central India and states covering UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh received less amount of annual rainfall during 1991 2020 compared to 1961 2020. The maximum one day annual rainfall had decreased in the states of Punjab, Haryana, UP, Bihar, parts of West Bengal, Rajasthan. Rainwater management   Changes in rainfall intensities, dry spells, extreme rainfall at daily interval and wet spells at 3 7  day interval were assessed and rainfall intensity, duration and frequency relations under different climate change scenarios were developed. It was observed that while there is an increase in rainfall observed in eastern and western parts of India, parts of central and states covering UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh received less amount of annual rainfall during 1991 2020 compared to 1961 2020.   The weather data for RCP 4.6 from 2020 2049 and the base data from 1971 to 2020 for Hyathnagar geo location, were analyzed for annual peak rainfalls to understand the behaviour of extreme rainfall patterns in the region. It was observed that during the base period of 50 years, there were common peak rainfall varying from 50 to 100 mm except in 2020 with 300 mm. Crops and cropping systems   Strip row intercropping system of Sorghum and Pigeonpea  4 4  with BBF yielded  798 kg pigeonpea seed equivalent per ha  on par with the Strip system without BBF  779 kg  ha  as sorghum  CSV27  grain filling was affected by 13 days dry spell and pigeonpea  TDRG 4  yields did not significantly differed with the BBF measure. However, 60 110 kg horsegram seed and fodder from Relay horsegram was a bonus from the pigeonpea interrow spacing. Strip system of Sorghum   pigeonpea  4 4   Relay horsegram within 6 pigeonpea rows performed better than the system with sequence horsegram in absence of rainfall during post monsoon season.   Evaluation of low cost approaches for management of Fall Army Worm  FAW , Spodoptera frugiperda in maize indicated that the mean incidence larval population during the vegetative and reproductive stages was lower in chemical and integrated treatments and was more evident in maize  cowpea intercropping system than sole crop of maize.   The population of free living nitrogen fixing bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. decreased with the reduction in soil moisture content from 22 to 4.7  .   TmapGen  is an automated thematic map generating web based software tool. Thematic map is generated based on the user input. Non GIS users can visualize their biophysical and socio  economic data as thematic maps on the fly. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 xvi   The moisture deficit stress  MS  at flowering stage and elevated temperature  eT  individually and in combination reduced biochemical and physiological parameters of maize hybrids.   Application of recommended NPK   foliar spray of nano urea   nano Zn   nano Cu being on par with 75  or 100  recommended NPK   foliar spray of either nano N alone or in combination with nano Zn recorded significantly higher grain yield  3211 kg ha  compared to other treatments. In another experiment, Application of Nano DAP with N75P75KZn  3090 kg ha  and N100P100KZn  3206 kg ha  recorded marginally higher grain yield compared to recommended dose of fertilizer without Nano DAP  N100P100KZn   2996 kg ha .   Organic sources have increased fibre content of rabi sorghum seeds which has physical properties such as water holding capacity and adds bulk to the diet and increases transit time in the gut which delays digestion of food in stomach resulting in the delay in cholesterol absorption in human nutrition.   The net carbon sequestered in agroforestry systems over the simulated period of thirty years was found maximum in Melia dubia based agroforestry systems 201.54 Mg C  ha yr and the least was noticed in aonla based agroforestry systems. 64.80 Mg C  ha  yr. Soil and nutrient management   An experiment was started on maize pigeon pea crop rotation during 2012 at GRF, ICAR CRIDA, Hyderabad. This year results showed that in maize crop, significantly higher mean grain yield recorded in no tillage  2694.1 kg ha  followed by reduced tillage  2466.4kg ha  and conventional tillage  2231.6 kg ha .   During this year, application of recommended NPK   foliar spray of nano urea   nano Zn   nano Cu being on par with 75  or 100  recommended NPK   foliar spray of either nano N alone or in combination with nano Zn recorded significantly higher maize grain yield  3211 kg ha  compared to other treatments.   During this year, application of recommended NP   100  recommended K through POLY4 being on par with other treatments recorded significantly higher groundnut pod yield  1556 kg ha  compared to application of recommended NP alone or in combination with 50  K through MOP or gypsum   500 kg ha, and Control.   During this year, field experiment on the addition of different doses of Ca bentonite  150 200 mesh natural white colour  on maize crop was conducted. Results showed that treatment viz. 15 t Ca  bentonite ha 75   RDF  and 15 t Ca bentonite  ha 100   RDF  found quite effective in improving the maize grain yield as compared to the other treatments.   Raised bed and CF recorded 37 and 48  higher cotton crop yield as compared to flat sowing, respectively. Similarly, cotton crop yield was higher with 125  RDF as compared to 100  RDF and control treatments. Application of 100 and 125  recommended fertilizers recorded 59 and 66  higher yield as compared to no fertilizer application. 125  RDF recorded 16  higher yield as compared to 100  RDN.   An experiment was initiated with the integration of in situ moisture conservation with CA practice in maize pigeonpea system in 2014. This year in the maize crop, integration of in situ moisture conservation practices either through conservation furrow or bed and furrow method in both CA and conventional tillage has recorded higher yield as compared to no moisture conservation treatments. Among the conservation treatments permanent conservation furrow recorded higher yields.   A field experiment was conducted every year since 2016 in sandy loam soil of Gunegal Research Farm at ICAR CRIDA, Hyderabad. This year results revealed that in pearl millet  PM  horsegram  HG  sequence pigeonpea  PP  rotation, significantly higher yield was obtained in ZT  1100 kg ha  compared to CT  831 kg ha  in 2022. In this experiment, pooled data of 7 years  2016 2022  revealed that significantly higher pearl millet equivalent yields were obtained in minimum tillage  MT  with 125  RDF compared to zero tillage  ZT  and conventional tillage  CT .   Assessed the soil quality parameters and developed the soil indices  SQI and RSQI  for predominant rainfed areas of Karnataka falling in AESR 6.2 ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 xvii under different crops and cropping systems. Results showed that in most of the case large farmers field recorded the high values of SQI and RSQI as compared to the small farmers field.   A Pot study was conducted with baby corn  var  IMHB 1539  to evaluate the release pattern of P. In this study, it was found that the URP  Udaipur rock phosphate  application along with zeolite was at par with SSP in maintaining soil P availability at three different stages of crop growth, while HRP  Hirapur rock phosphate  maintained the lowest soil P availability during three different stages of crop growth. Livestock management   In an investigation carried out to fetch the benefit of crop residue into Total Mixed Ration  TMR  as well as fortify them with suitable additives to enable indigenous sheep to overcome heat stress it was seen that garlic skin powder, curry leaf powder and onion skin powder were added to the Dry TMR   3  as fortification option to provide endurance to heat stress during summer. The ration had Crude protein   11.5 , Crude fat   4 to 5 , and Crude fibre   18 to 19  and had good palatability. An improved growth rate was observed in terms of ADG as 66g per day in Fortified TMR  FTMR  group as compared to 51g per day in Non fortified TMR  NFTMR  group. Energy management   An autonomous platform was developed with boom sprayer and weeding attachment for raised bed planting system. Developed platform tested for LiDAR guidance system and found satisfactory.   Sorghum and maize harvester were developed for Off set mounting of tractor for cutting, conveying and windrowing units of harvester which can be operated by the PTO and mounted on 3 point hitch.   A prototype of battery powered reaper was developed and tested for harvesting of short and bushy crops like soybean, safflower, chickpea, rice, greengram etc. It observed that developed prototype has a great potential to reduces the drudgery involved in manual harvesting.   A prototype of solar powered prime mover developed with 1.5 hp BLDC motor. Two separate attachments of 3 tyne cultivator and 3 row planter was also developed and tested in field condition.   The hydraulic system assisted weeding machine gave satisfactory results across different types of weed species and moisture contents with average field capacity of 0.5ha  hr. Socio Economic studies and transfer of technology   Analysis of social network map of all the four villages showed denser network in treated villages as compared to control villages. It is also found that graph density, average degree and average clustering co efficient values are high in treated villages. Moreover, average path length and modularity are low in treated villages representing more efficient communication in these villages.   Livelihood diversification of farm household in pigeon pea growing areas has been assessed based on diversity index for farm and non farm activities of various categories of farmers revealed that small and marginal farmers have higher diversity index when compared to medium and large farmers.   Farmers FIRST project demonstrated the soil test based balanced fertilizer application  26 60 0 5 kg N P20 K20 Zn ha  in chickpea crop in eight farmer field which produced 43 per cent higher yield seed yield over the farmer practice  22.5 57  0 0 KgN P2O K2O Zn ha . Demonstration of improved fodder production and management with CO 4 and Super Napier varieties resulted in a yield of 175 t ha, which has a potential to support almost 200 sheep.   A framework was developed to study the wellbeing which consisted of five parameters viz material, health, social security, social relations and freedom.   Through village studies developed inequality indices and implementation of different government schemes. Inequalities in per capita household income were less than owned land inequalities. The income from livestock, off farm and non farm incomes are more equal. Direct benefit transfers have become the main mode of government support to small farmers. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 xviii   Productivities of important rainfed crops for rainfed and irrigated production systems were estimated at State level. A new measure developed for assessing yield sustainability of treatments  practices evaluated in long term experiments was further improved. Scheduled Caste Sub Programme   As a part of  Annadata Devo Bhava  Campaign under AZADI KA AMRUT MAHOSTAV, celebrating 75 years of India s Independence, an awareness programme on  Balanced Fertilization for Soil Health Maintenance and Productivity Enhancement  was organized at Mallampeta village of Kotapally mandal of Mancherial district.   Kadaknath birds  250 nos.  along with feed material were distributed to 40 households in Bhoparam village of Kotapally mandal for backyard poultry farming. The intervention has the potential for not only income generation but also nutritional security. The farmers could able to generate additional income through the selling of birds.   An improved variety of red gram  PRG 176  was introduced in the cluster of eight villages of Kotapally mandal to increase the cropping intensity and soil health. To increase the area under red gram, 750 kg seeds  each 3 kg bag  distributed to 250 farmers during June 2022.   Four stroke petrol engine power sprayers  27 nos.  were distributed to selected villages of Kotapally namely, Kondampet, Bopparam, Alugama, kotaplly, Eddabandam, Paripally, Pinnaram, Esanvai, Saraivapeta, Shetpally, Laximipur, Repanpally and Nakkalapally under custom hiring mode.

The WUE 6.68 kg ha mm, net returns  Rs.43906  ha  and benefit cost ratio  2.15  were found higher under complete mechanization All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology   A study on vegetation responses to meteorological drought in agricultural fields at different stations of Gujarat indicated that no significant association exist between SPEI and NDVI at Anand. This suggests crop conditions have a low dependency on monsoon wetness. However, at Bhuj, the vegetation condition of crop fields was found to be significantly responsive to the wetness of September  SPEII and SPEI2  and agricultural crop conditions during kharif and rabi seasons near Bhuj, largely dependent on the wetness of August and September months.   At Bhubaneswar, the percentage probability for the occurrence of meteorological drought was computed for 30 years  1991 2020  at the block level for the districts of Kalahandi and Nuapada. The probability of occurrence of moderate droughts at different blocks of Kalahandi district ranged from 7 to 27   while it was 10 to 17  in Nuapada district.   At Jorhat, an analysis was carried out to assess the drought severity in 27 districts of Assam state using SPI with two time scales  annual and southwest monsoon  for the period of 28 years  1988 2015  revealed that in extreme drought condition  SPI less than  2.0  was not witnessed in any districts of the state during the study period.   Climatic water balance was worked out for Parbhani on a weekly basis and the results revealed that Moisture Availability Index increased from 24 SMW and declined from 42 SMW. The total length of the growing period was 19 weeks i.e. from 24 to 42 SMW at Parbhani.   Bt cotton Balwan recorded a significantly higher seed cotton yield  1019 kg ha  than hirsutum cotton AKH 081  859.50 kg ha 1  and arboreum cotton AKA 7  767 kg ha  at Akola. Thermal use efficiency was found to be higher for monsoon  sown crop  28 June  with respect to both seed cotton and biomass production and it decreased in subsequent late sowing.   At Raipur, the highest RUE was recorded by three treatments  0.67 g MJ  viz., Vaibhav sown on 10 Nov, JG 16 sown on 25 Nov and JG 14  ZC  sown on 10 Dec. JG 16 sown on 10 Dec recorded the lowest RUE of 0.21 g MJ across the treatments.   Crop simulation model CERES millet which was calibrated predicted the phenology, biomass yield and final grain yields well within the limits. The D index values showed for anthesis, maturity days, LAI, grain yield and above ground biomass were 0.97, 0.99, 0.99, 0.91 and 0.91, respectively.   A simple weather based disease prediction model for cotton leaf curl virus disease was developed by the Hisar centre. The optimum range of weather parameters with the progression of maximum PDI value from 22 to 45 SMWs was analyzed and found to be 32.3 to 36.3 oC  maximum temperature , 24.5 to 29.6 oC  minimum temperature  and 73.2 to 86.7.0 per cent  morning relative humidity  and 7.0 to 9.1 hrs  bright sunshine hours .   The Dynamic Crop Weather Calendar  DCWC , a decision support system developed by AICRPAM has been validated for 75 districts in the country for major crops grown in the respective districts. National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture  NICRA  Projects at ICAR CRIDA   The elevated crop canopy temperature  eT  and eCO2 along with eT  eT eCO2  has minimum influence on the phenology of days to 50 per cent flowering of black gram genotypes, except with IPU 094 1 where an earliness of 4 days was recorded under eT eCO2 condition. The eT reduced photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of all four black gram genotypes. The eT significantly impacted biomass ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 xx and yield components. The reduction in seed yield was mainly due to reduction in pod and seed number revealing that high temperature impacted both flowers to pod conversion and seed set.   In potato the tuber size, biomass, yield, and marketable yield of potatoes cultivated under varying CO2 concentrations and temperatures were analyzed. There were significant differences in the number of small    30 g , medium  30 80 g , and large    80 g  potatoes. The tuber size was greater under eCO2 than under the Control, eCO2  eTemp conditions and smallest under eTemp conditions.   Nutritive value of groundnut haulms in terms of CP and digestibility decreased under elevated temperature and elevated temperature and carbon dioxide environmental conditions.   Plant abiotic stress images were classified with pre  trained image classification model VGG 16 and obtained 56  accuracy with limited dataset.   The impact of eCO2 and eTemp on primary parameters of Spodoptera frugiperda  J.E. Smith  in maize indicated that higher consumption of foliage and higher larval weights at interactive levels of both dimensions with an extended larval duration which was found to decrease with eTemp.   Higher percent increase in the annual number of generations of H. armigera on pigeonpea was predicted to occur in FDP  7.65 to 37.83 percent  over the baseline, followed by the DP  7.47 to 21.89 percent  and NP  5.25 to 9.51percent  periods with a reduction of generation time across the four RCP scenarios. Among locations, more number of generations of H. armigera with reduced generation time are likely at Coimbatore and Warangal locations.   Black gram genotypes showed high variation in terms of its physiological efficiency both under well  watered and water deficit stress conditions. Black gram genotypes PDU 1, IPU96 7 and IPU13 5 were found to be superior in yield performance as compared others.   Nitrous oxide  N2O  emissions factor     was significantly low under high pasture block of the experimental field compared to the low and medium pasture blocks and higher during rainy season. The mean estimated emission factors from the present study were lower than the IPCC  1996  default value for cattle.

Rainfed agriculture constitutes a major part of Indian agriculture, necessitating a comprehensive approach and multi disciplinary research for improving food and nutritional security while conserving and managing natural resources in the country. Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO  of the United Nations indicated the tremendous potential of rainfed agriculture which could feed the entire world by use of improved technology. The geographic and demographic dimensions of rainfed agriculture warrant a continued priority for production systems in it, in general, and rainfed agricultural research and extension in particular. Short or long term fluctuations in weather patterns, climate variability and climate change can influence production systems and in turn crop yields. The impending effects of climate change will further add the dimension of urgency to rainfed agriculture as the problems of poverty, hunger and resource degradation are likely to be exacerbated if appropriate measures are not initiated as 81 per cent of rural poor in India are engaged in rainfed agriculture. It was not until 1923 that the first systematic and scientific approach to the problem of dryland farming research was initiated. These were the earliest attempts made to improve the system and tackle the problems of rainfed areas  scarcity tracts  of the erstwhile Bombay State. During 1933 35, the then Imperial  now Indian  Council of Agricultural Research  ICAR  initiated a broad based dryland farming research project at Solapur, Bijapur, Hagari, Raichur and Rohtak to formulate appropriate strategies. After independence, renewed efforts were made to improve the stability and productivity of rainfed agriculture through efforts on developing appropriate Soil and Water Conservation practices. Recognizing the importance of rainfed agriculture, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research launched the All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture  AICRPDA  in 1970 at Hyderabad with 23 centres spread across the country and presently operating in 31 centres. The importance of weather and the science of Agrometeorology in agriculture was realized and on the recommendations of the National Commission on Agriculture, All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology  AICRPAM  was launched in 1983 by ICAR to strengthen research in Agrometeorology with 10 centres across the country and which has presently been increased to 25 centres. Realizing the enormity and complexity of rainfed agriculture, the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture  ICAR CRIDA  was established at Hyderabad on April 12, 1985, to provide leadership in basic and strategic research in dryland agriculture and to address the location specific problems in association with AICRPDA and AICRPAM centres. ICAR CRIDA is a constituent organization of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research  ICAR  under the Natural Resource Management Division, an autonomous body of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India. Mandate   To undertake basic and applied research for sustainable and climate resilient agriculture in rainfed areas   To Co ordinate network research for generating location specific technologies in rainfed areas   To serve as a centre for capacity enhancement in natural resource management in drylands Based on the work done under the National Project on Climate Change  NPCC , ICAR launched the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture  NICRA  in 2011 as a network project which is being coordinated by CRIDA. The project has four major components viz., strategic research to address long  term climate change, technology demonstration in farmers  fields in the most vulnerable districts to cope with the current climate variability, competitive grant  sponsored research component and capacity building of stakeholders at different levels. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 2 CRIDA s major research programmes and areas of research under the programmes  Programme No. Programmes Areas of Research I Resource characterization Rainfall and soil characteristics, length of the growing season, land capability based potential and constraints, climatic analysis, crop weather modelling and geographic information system.

Drought monitoring, planning and management  Improving food security and resilience of the drought affected states in India A collaborative project between ICAR CRIDA, Hyderabad and IWMI, Sri Lanka was carried out as part of ICAR IWMI work plan to 1  validate the South Asia Drought monitoring system index  IDSI  for rainfed and irrigated agriculture for selected drought prone sub districts on developmental scale, 2  evolve mechanism of linking spatial drought information with drought management planning on near real time basis at sub district level and district level and develop spatially distributed integrated drought mitigation plans including supply, augmentation and demand management interventions as improved preparedness to drought proofing, and 3  develop and recommend protocol for drought monitoring and mitigation with inbuilt contingency measures including capacity development. Monsoon season  both south west and north east  for rainfall departures, dryspells and maximum dryspell during the season were monitored. District based normal, actual and departure from normal was estimated for each district and for whole India is given in the following figures. Categorization of districts  as per IMD criteria  based on normal rainfall and actual status during kharif season 2022 Normal Rainfall  mm  LD D N E LE No. of Districts  500 5 21 42 39 39 146 500 750 9 40 49 37 9 144 750 1000 1 80 63 36 16 196 1000 1500 1 33 70 25 1 130  1500 1 13 53 10 1 78 No. of Districts 17 187 277 147 66 694 ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 12 2.2.2. Prioritized water conservation options and designs considerations under climate change scenario Changes in rainfall intensities, dry spells, extreme rainfall at daily interval and wet spells at 3 7 day interval were assessed and rainfall intensity, duration and frequency relations under different climate change scenarios were developed. The major objectives were 1  To assess the runoff potential at sub district level across India for different cropping systems and 2  To prioritise and redesign the water harvesting systems  both in situ and ex situ  for different agro ecologies. Based on grid based rainfall information, quantification was made for changes in annual rainfall across India for two time periods i.e. 1961 1990 and 1991 2020. While there is an increase in rainfall observed in eastern and western parts of India, parts of central and states covering UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh received less amount of annual rainfall during 1991  2020 compared to 1961 2020. Maximum one day annual rainfall is increased in many districts across the country. In the states of Punjab, Haryana, UP, Bihar, parts of West Bengal, Rajasthan, the maximum one day annual rainfall had decreased. 2.2.3. District Agricultural Contingency Plans  DACP  ICAR  through NRM division and CRIDA , based on the suggestion of The Parliamentary Consultative Committee on Agriculture, Food, Civil supplies and Consumer Affairs, Government of India  GOI , along with agricultural universities and KVKs developed contingency plans at district level for 650 districts spread across all the 126 agro climatic zones of the country to deal with weather related aberrations. The district based contingency plans are prepared for 650 districts in the country and hosted on ICAR DAC websites http   agricoop.nic.in acp.html, http   crida.in  and circulated to all state agriculture departments during interface meetings. A total of 514 DACPs have been updated till now. During the year 2022, following the forecast of India Meteorological Department  during April and May  and SASCOF  during April , from above normal rainfall condition to normal condition, interface meetings were organised across six states  Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Telangana and Karnataka  during the season. During the season, normal to above normal monsoon was witnessed in many states, deficient to large deficient monsoon was observed in states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and parts of North East Region. However, these states received above normal rainfall during the months of October to December in large number of districts facilitating better rabi prospects. Since the commencement of organization of interface meetings for operationalization of contingency plans from 2014, a total of 61 meetings were held across different states. 2.2.4. Groundwater recharge prospects The rainfall distribution coupled with total rainfall greatly influence the ground water recharge during the monsoon period. Since the exact estimation of groundwater recharge would require considerable time and large quantities of data, a qualitative estimation of groundwater recharge prospects due to rainfall was devised by interpreting the rainfall received on a week Changes in maximum on day rainfall for two time periods of 1961 1990 and 1991  2020 ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 13 to week basis at district level. For example, if scanty rainfall is received in more than 65  of weeks or deficit rainfall is received are more than 80  of weeks on cumulative basis, the recharge possibility is considered to be extremely low. Rainfall data available from IMD  www.imd.gov. in  during the current monsoon was utilized for the analysis purpose. Based on the above criteria analyzed for about 675 districts in major states of the country, groundwater recharge due to monsoon rainfall was medium to normal in about 452. Extremely low to very low ground water recharge prospects was estimated in about 135 districts. 2.2.5. Peak rainfall analysis for developing Intensity Duration Frequency curves for RCP 4.6 The weather data for RCP 4.6 from 2020 2049 and the base data from 1971 to 2020 for Hyathnagar geo location, were analyzed for annual peak rainfalls to understand the behaviour of extreme rainfall patterns in the region. It was observed that during the base period of 50 years, there were common peak rainfall varying from 50 to 100 mm except in 2020 with 300 mm. However, during the period from 2020 to 2049  30 years , there were three peaks of rainfall varying from 150 to 300 mm at an increment of 5 years alternatively happening in the time series. After mid year of RCP 4.6, the peak rainfall drastically reduced with the range of 50 to 100 mm indicating no regular pattern of peak rainfall in the region. The above weather peak data were analyzed using IMD1 3 rule, probability analysis and frequency analysis using extreme gumbel distribution, the Intensity  Duration and Frequency curves for Hyathnagar were constructed as presented in the following figures for Annual peak rainfall in base period during 1971 to 2020 understanding the extreme rainfall intensities in the region. The peak rainfall was split into intensity for different durations  0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 hrs  for different frequencies  2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 . The analysis indicated that the intensities are maximum at all frequencies in RCP 4.6 having increasing trend in the intensities for all time durations. The average increase observed in RCP 4.6 was 7.93  over the base period intensities. However, the maximum increase was observed in lower durations of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 hr.

Crops and cropping systems 2.3.1. Development of mapping population and genetic enhancement for drought tolerance in maize Maize is mostly cultivated under rainfed condition during kharif season in India. The rainfed maize crop often get exposed to various abiotic stresses specially drought. Drought stress at anthesis silking initiation and grain filling stages causes significant yield losses in maize. Although number of hybrids are available in the seed chain, but these are mainly developed for irrigated system. The performance of hybrids under drought stress is very low as compared to irrigated system. Developing drought tolerant hybrids with better water use efficiency is very important to feed the ever increasing population. Identification of drought tolerant inbred, hybrids for water deficit conditions is paramount to break the yield plateau in stress prone rainfed condition. Identification of morpho  physiological traits associated with drought stress and using them in evaluation of genetic resources will be critical in crop improvement program. Seventeen experimental hybrids were evaluated under rainfed conditions during kharif 2022. The flowering and yield related traits such as days to anthesis  DA , days to silking  DS , anthesis silking interval  ASI , plant height  PH , cob height  CH , cob length  CL , cob girth  CG , row number per cob  RNC , seed number per row of cob  SNR , cob weight  CW , hundred seed weight  HSW , fodder weight  FY  and grain yield per plant  GY  were recorded. In another experiment, thirty selected recombinant inbred lines  RILs  of the mapping population  HKI161 SNJ201126  were evaluated rainfed conditions. A third experiment was conducted consisted of thirty short listed selected genotypes for identifying tolerant genotypes under rainfed conditions. The grain yield among hybrids varied from 85.15   117.50 g plant. Among hybrids evaluated SNJ2011 26  SNJ2011 37, HKI7660 SNJ2011 26, SNJ2011 37  RJR 385, RJR 385 SNJ2011 37, HKI 161 RJR 385, Z101 15 HKI 161, HKI 161 SNJ2011 26, SNJ2011  26 Z101 15 performed comparatively better than other hybrids. The selected thirty RILs also showed high variation for grain yield and yield attributes. In another experiment where 30 genotypes were evaluated, showed high variation for yield and its attributes. Among these genotypes, Z 101 15, SNJ  2011 70, DTL 4 1, DTL 2, Z 96 5, RJR 385, SNJ  2011 37 performed better than others. 2.3.2. Genetic enhancement for nutritionally rich high yielding horse gram varieties suitable for rainfed conditions Horse gram  Macrotyloma uniflorum  L.  Verdc  is an important drought hardy, climate resilient dual  purpose rainfed crop adaptable to grow in poor soils with very minimum or nil input and after care. It is the cheapest source of protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre for the rural and tribal population. It is known as a poor man s pulse because it is consumed only by the less privileged population of the society. The unfavourable taste and flavour of the cooked products and more cooking time are few of the reasons behind its less popularity. In addition to this, it contains some anti nutrient factors like phytates, poly phenols etc. These anti nutrient factors were found to be antioxidants and play beneficial role in reduction of coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. This year twenty two genotypes of horse gram genotypes including six checks were evaluated in RBD under rainfed conditions at HRF. Days to 50  flowering ranged from 53 70 days, plant height from 52.17 to 98.6 cm, number of branches per plant ranged from 3.6 to 9.2, number of pods per plant ranged from 31.4 to 146, pod weight per plant ranged from 2.47 to 9.37g, pod length per plant from 4 5  cm , seeds per pod from 4 7, hundred seed weight from 2.55 to 3.51g and seed yield from 2.4 to 4.97g. Variability analysis revealed high variability for number of pods and low or medium genotypic coefficient of variation for most of the characters. Highest heritability was observed for days to 50  flowering, followed by number of pods and seed yield. The characters days to 50  flowering, number of pods and pod weight were highly correlated with seed yield. Twenty two genotypes were divided in to 7 clusters and the clusters V and VII were solitary. The character days to flowering contributed maximum towards genetic diversity followed by days to flowering, number of pods, hundred seed weight, seed yield and pod weight. Days to 50  flowering and number of pods ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 15 were positively and significantly correlated with seed yield per plant. Pod weight recorded significant positive correlation with plant height and number of pods per plant. Number of pods per plant showed significant positive correlation with days to 50  flowering and plant height. Seeds per pod was highly significantly correlated with pod length. Evaluation of horse gram germplasm from ICAR  NBPGR Around hundred germplasm received from ICAR  NBPGR regional station, Hyderabad was evaluated in augmented block design at Hayathnagar Research Farm. Data was recorded on yield and yield parameters. Scoring for yellow mosaic virus was also done. Evaluation of mutant population Three released varieties of horse gram CRIDA 18R, CRHG 19 and CRHG 22 were treated with two doses of EMS  Ethyl Methane Sulfonate  viz., 0.2 and 0.3 . The surviving plants of M1 population were harvested on single plant basis and the seeds were sown separately on separate rows to advance the generation. M2 population was evaluated for biometrical characters and selected plants were harvested on single plant basis to advance to the next generation. Evaluation of F2 and F3 population of horse gram Generation advancement of 9 F2 crosses and 12 F3 crosses of horse gram were carried out. Single plants were selected, data were recorded and harvested. There was lot of variation for yield and its attributes. Multilocation trial of horse gram Twelve entries including three released varieties of CRIDA as check were evaluated in RBD in three replications at HRF. The entries HG 22 23 was earlier in flowering and maturity and the entry HG 22 15 recorded longest days to flowering and maturity. HG  22 19 was the highest yielding entry followed by HG  22 22 and HG 22 23. Breeder seed production of released varieties Breeder seed production of CRIDA released varieties viz., CRHG 19, CRHG 22 and CRIDA 18R were carried out and about 12 quintal breeder seed is produced during this year. Field view of germplasm evaluation Field view of mutant population evaluation 2.3.3. Assessing the potential of mechanized strip row intercropping systems for crop intensification as a climate adaptive strategy in rainfed agriculture An experiment on evolving mechanized operations other than the mechanized sowing of strip row intercropping systems  already established  in cropping systems suitable for rainfed lands  for which , along with the soil and water conservation measure of BBF was carried out in Hayathnagar Research Farm during the year 2022. As a bonus opportune crop  either as a relay crop or as a sequence crop in place of harvested medium duration cereal millet crop short duration legume , horsegram in this case, with mechanized management operations was also tried. CRIDA nine row planter with a bar of 2.7 m was used for the successful sowing of the system and also the BBF planter was used successfully. The test crops were sorghum bajra, pigeonpea and horsegram as an opportune crop. In this experiment, performance of ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 16 strip row intercropping system with BBF was compared with the strip row intercropping system without BBF. Both the sorghum and pigeonpea crop yielded on an average 3 4q and 4 5q per hectare respectively in addition to fodder yield from both sorghum and horsegram. In spite of two high rainfall events occurring during the first 40 days of the cropping period, there was no noticeable difference in grain production between the strip row intercropping systems with BBF and those Pigeonpea seed equivalents  kg ha  of 4 4 Sorghum and Pigeonpea strip row intercropping systems with and without Broadbed and Furrow, with the opportune horsegram relay or sequence cropping during 2022 Field view of 4 4 Sorghum and Pigeonpea strip row intercropping systems  Kharif 2022 2.3.4. Development of resource efficient climate resilient cropping system in rainfed Alfisols A field experiment was carried out with 13 pulse oilseed cropping system to identify a remunerative and climate adaptive double cropping system and to quantify the effect of rain water management and rotation benefit on partitioning of assimilate and safflower yield. The systems were green gram safflower  without rainwater management , green gram safflower  with rainwater management , cowpea  safflower  without rainwater management , cowpea  safflower  with rainwater management , black gram  safflower  without rainwater management , black gram safflower  without rainwater management , green gram sesame  without rainwater management , green gram sesame  with rainwater management , cowpea  sesame  without rainwater management , cowpea sesame  with rainwater management , black gram sesame  without rainwater management , black gram sesame  with rainwater management  and sorghum   pigeonpea. The pulses were sown during the kharif and the oilseed crops were sown after the harvest of pulse crop  October . The crops under rainwater management were given 2 supplementary irrigation  3mm  from the water harvested. without BBF for the rainfall distribution in 2022. These high rainfall events have negative impact on retention of BBF in rainfed Alfisols. Pigeonpea as a cash crop component did not perform well with reduced plant height  120 135 cm , declined branch number  10  12  due to rainless period from mid October to mid  December besides it being a medium duration crop. Sorghum performed well while relay horse gram did not suffer from lack of sunshine in the pigeonpea rows. Sesamum without rain water management Safflower with rainwater management Cowpea with rainwater management ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 17 System yield of various pulse oilseed cropping system Since the outputs from each system are different, they were compared on the basis of green gram equivalent yield and system productivity. The highest system productivity of 1695kg ha was obtained with cowpea  sesame  with rain water management , followed by cowpea  sesame  without rain water management   1484kg ha  on par with cowpea  safflower  with rain water management   1407kg ha . Higher yield of cowpea and higher market price of sesame contributed to higher system productivity of these system. 2.3.5. Individual and interactive effects of moisture deficit and elevated temperature on physiological efficiency of C3 and C4 rainfed crops Two maize  Zea mays L.  genotypes  DHM 117 and 900M GOLD were assessed for physiological, growth and yield responses under moisture deficit stress  MS  at flowering stage raised under ambient and elevated temperature  eT  conditions. During the crop growth period the maximum temperature ranged from 24.0 to 34.2 C. The study revealed that MS and MS eT significantly decreased photosynthetic rate  Anet  of both the genotypes whereas eT condition improved it. Among the genotypes, 900M GOLD was less impacted than DHM 117 and the MS eT has higher impact than MS. The impact of these conditions on Anet was higher than transpiration rate  Tr  and this reflected in decreased WUE. Increase in temperature  eT , MS and MS eT resulted in decreased RWC, cell membrane stability and increased MDA content and accumulation of total soluble sugars and proline. Among the two genotypes, the impact of stresses was high for proline in DHM 117 while for TSS in 900M GOLD. The impact of MS eT on these parameters was higher than individual impact of MS and eT Response of biochemical and physiological parameters of two maize hybrids  DHM 117 and 900M GOLD under moisture stress  MS , elevated temperature  eT  and their combination  MS eT  conditions MDA  Malondialdehyde  TSS  Total soluble sugars  WUE  Water use efficiency revealing that combination of two abiotic stresses have additive impact on physiological performance of this C4 crop. The reduction in total biomass was higher under MS and MS eT condition than eT, while eT condition improved the grain yield of both maize genotypes indicating that higher temperature improving the partitioning of biomass towards grain. Both stress conditions improved the HI revealing that it triggered higher partitioning of biomass towards seeds. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 18 Among the two genotypes, 900M GOLD recorded less reduction of both biomass and grain yield under these conditions. The higher accumulation of sugars   proline especially under these abiotic stress conditions enabled the tolerant genotype to perform better. 2.3.6. Rhizo microbiome of rainfed crops under semi arid region of India A pot experiment with groundnut  cv. K 9  as a test crop was conducted for the 2nd consecutive season under rainout shelter to evaluate the effect of varying levels of soil moisture stress on soil microbial population and plant growth as well as physiological properties. Soil moisture     at different levels of moisture stress Influence of differing soil moisture content on different functional groups of soil microorganisms The soil moisture content at field capacity and 20 days moisture stress was 22.0  and 4.7  , respectively. Culturable soil microbial population such as bacteria, fungi, Pseudomonas spp. actinomycetes, free living nitrogen fixing bacteria  NFB  and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria  PSB  was enumerated by using appropriate growth media. The population of NFB, Pseudomonas spp. and PSB decreased with the reduction in soil moisture content from 22.0   to 4.7 . Effect of soil moisture stress on culturable soil microbial population Rabi sorghum collected from AICRPDA centre, Vijayapura, Karnataka  PSB Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria, NFB  Free living nitrogen fixing bacteria, d  Days after moisture stress The soil moisture stress was imposed at 42 DAS  flowering  and 91 DAS  pod development . Plant physiological parameters such as relative water content, total soluble sugars and proline contents were measured at different levels of soil moisture content. Relative water content reduced from 89.73   to 23.50   with the depletion in soil moisture content. Total soluble sugars  TSS  and proline ranged from 12.57   36.03  mg g fresh weight  and 0.16  1.40  mg g fresh weight  respectively. Proline and TSS contents increased with decrease in soil moisture content. The plant parameters such as plant biomass, shoot length, number of pods and pod weight were recorded. The plant biomass ranged from 92.50 to 354.50  g plant  and decreased with the reduction in soil moisture content. 2.3.7. Nutritional profiling of major rainfed crops from diverse agro ecologies This study has been taken up to study different nutritional parameters in major rain fed food crops across different agro ecological zones of the country. According to the seven treatments T1  Control, T2  RPP  Recommended package of practices , T3  50  N through FYM   50  N inorganic sources, T4  50  N through vermi compost   50  N inorganic sources, T5   50  N through sun hemp   50  N inorganic sources, T6  50  N through glyricidia toppings   50  N inorganic sources and T7  50  N Crop residues   50   N inorganic sample were collected from AICRPDA centre, Vijayapura, Karnataka. Crude fibre in rabi sorghum were estimated in these samples. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 19 Crude fibre content     of different Rabi sorghum treatments 2.3.8. Dry fortified Total Mixed Ration  TMR  for indigenous sheep Sustainable nutrient management by scientifically utilizing the crop residues and their suitable fortification can economize the small ruminant production system in dryland regions of India. The current investigation has been carried out to fetch the benefit of crop residue into Total Mixed Ration  TMR  as well as fortify them with suitable additives to enable indigenous sheep to overcome heat stress. The overall objective of the project is to prepare combinations of dry crop residues as fortified TMR ration for fattening sheep. Body weight  kg  of Nellore sheep during 90 days of rearing under fortified and non fortified TMR feeding regimen Garlic skin powder, curry leaf powder and onion skin powder were added to the Dry TMR   3  as fortification option to provide endurance to heat stress during summer. The ration had Crude protein   11.5 , Crude fat   4 to 5 , and Crude fibre   18 to 19  and had good palatability. An improved growth rate was observed in terms of ADG as 66g per day in Fortified TMR  FTMR  group as compared to 51g per day in Non fortified TMR  NFTMR  group. 2.3.9. Evaluation of low cost approaches for the management of Fall Army Worm  FAW , Spodoptera frugiperda in maize Different experimental trials were conducted to evaluate the low cost approaches for the management of Fall Armyworm  FAW  in maize crops. The fall armyworm  FAW , Spodoptera frugiperda  J. E. Smith   Lepidoptera  Noctuidae , is a new invasive polyphagous insect pest, causing severe defoliation and significant yield losses in important cereal crops like maize, and rice, sorghum, cotton, and vegetables. Control of this insect pest by adopting chemical control measures is found to be costly and unsustainable. With this background evaluation of low cost approaches for the management of Fall Armyworm  FAW  was initiated. Creation of crop diversity by adopting intercropping systems like maize   pigeonpea and maize  cowpea in a 1 2 ratio was done and was compared over maize sole crop. The three cropping systems were included as main plots and sequential application of various pest control options  components was adopted to have low cost evaluation. Various pest control options treatment areas follow i. application of K nutrition  higher dose of K  20 kg  ha , ii. Prophylactic  application of dry fine sand after sieving in leaf whorl of maize crop at regular intervals, Application of 5  sugar solution , iii. Biorational  application of NSKE 5  and Vitex negundo leaf extract solution 1 10 w w , iv. Chemical  insecticide application of emamectin benzoate, chlorantraniliprole, Thiodicarb, v. Integrated measures  integration of all measures excepting chemical treatment , and vi. untreated check  without any application for pest control . These served as subplots and the design of the experiment was a split plot and all were replicated thrice. Data on pest incidence and the impact of various pest control approaches on the absolute larval population during the vegetative and flowering stages across three cropping systems is depicted here. Significant variation of the larval population was noted among three cropping systems and treatments in the vegetative and flowering stages. The reduction of pest population was higher in chemical and integrated treatments and was at par with each other. The rest of the treatments also caused a reduction of the larval population than the untreated check. The mean incidence larval population during the vegetative stage ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 20 was lower in chemical and integrated treatments  F 5,34   244.79  P 0.01  and was more evident in Maize  cowpea intercropping system  F2,34   59.52  P 0.01  than the sole crop of maize crop. The interaction between cropping systems and treatments was also significant  F10,34   3.91  P 0.01 . A similar trend was noted during the flowering stage also. 2.3.10. Crop Pest Surveillance and Advisory Project  CROPSAP  Daily weather data  Tmax, Tmin, Morning RH and rainfall  was collected from IMD Mumbai www. imdmumbai.gov.in, Nagpur   www.imdnagpur.gov.in, Pune  www. aws.imd.gov.in 8091 websites and Rainfall   Mahawedh project. Missing daily weather data was also compiled from IMD Automatic Weather Stations  IMD AWS , for all districts during 2021 22. Corresponding pest data was collected from website and downloading pest data as per SMW for district and Tehsil level. Isoline maps were prepared using ARCGIS for maximum and minimum temperatures and interpolation maps of RH, rainfall and moisture adequacy index  MAI  superimposed with pest data received from field scouts for different crops viz., soybean, cotton, rice, pigeonpea, chickpea, maize, Effect of cropping systems and low external input pest management approaches on larval incidence of Spodoptera frugiperda during the vegetative and flowering stages in maize Temperature dependent developmental rate of larval instars of Sorghum aphid estimated by non linear models sorghum and sugarcane. These maps were provided regularly to different partner institutes of CROPSAP project and the Commissioner, Department of Agriculture, Govt. of Maharashtra for facilitating pest control advisory. All the maps generated during the year were uploaded on weekly basis in the Crop Pest DSS website of CRIDA highlighting the risk prone districts for different pests and diseases.

Temperature dependent growth and development of sorghum aphid Laboratory experiments were conducted under environmental growth chambers to study the effect of different temperatures on growth and development of sorghum aphid, Melanaphis sacchari. The studied were undertaken at seven constant temperatures  15, 18,20, 25, 27, 30 and 32   1oC . The relative humidity was maintained in the chambers at 60   10 , photoperiod at 12  12 hrs. The growth, survival, developmental duration   fecundity was observed at frequent intervals. Estimated pre oviposition, oviposition, post  oviposition, adult longevity and fecundity per individual at seven constant temperatures. Growth parameters and temperature thresholds were estimated for nymphal stages using four different linear and non linear models viz., Campbell, Ikemoto Takai model, Lactin   2 and Simplified beta type function. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 21 Rate of development of first and third instars was linear from 15 30 C and 15 25 C respectively. Ikemoto  Takai linear model fit was better than Campbell model across all nymphal instars. However, the total nymphal development rate was fitted better by Campbell model with an R2 of 0.8. The thermal constant, k for the nymphal instars were between 10.9 to 17.6 DD. For total nymph the estimated thermal degree days was 98.9. The nonlinear relationship between developmental rate and temperature for different nymphal instars and total nymph of Sorghum aphid was fitted well by all the three nonlinear models viz., Lactin 2, Briere and   type distribution function model by additionally including rates at 32 C. The estimated upper temperature threshold Tmax by Lactin 2 and Briere models was 34.0 C across all instars. The estimated Topt for the total nymphal development were 28.6, 27.7 and 26.8 from Lactin 2, Briere and Beta function respectively.

Development of temperature based phenology model for maize stem borer  Chilo partellus  Laboratory studies were conducted to develop an inclusive temperature dependent population growth model for maize stem borer, Chilo partellus Swinhoe  Lepidoptera  Crambidae . The larvae were reared on maize leaves. Experiments on life tables were conducted at different constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 35 C. The data on durations of egg, larval, pupal and adult and total development periods at each temperature were recorded. The Insect Life Cycle Modelling  ILCYM  software version 3.0, developed by the International Potato Centre, Lima, Peru  https   research.cip.cgiar.org confluence  displayilcym Downloads  was used for the development of process  based temperature driven and age stage structured C. partellus phenology model. The model was validated using life table data at fluctuating temperatures. Finally, with life table parameters, temperature inclusion in the phenology model using a cosines approximation of temperature, three indices such as growth index  GI , activity index  AI , establishment risk index  ERI  are estimated. The risk indices thus estimated were employed in the  potential population distribution and mapping  module of ILCYM for visualizing the risk maps. The module facilitated spatial simulations of pest populations through grid based within a de ned area according to grid speci c monthly temperatures interpolated from available databases  www.worldclim . The process generated ASCII  les  .asc  which were converted to grid format  .grd  for visualizing the risk maps by importing in DIVA GIS  http   www.diva  gis.org . The indices were mapped for predicting the suitability for establishment and survival of C. partellus in India under present and future climatic scenarios. Results indicated that, the temperatures within the evaluation range have a greater influence on the development of the immature life stages of C. partellus. The duration of the immature stages and the time required completing the cycle from egg to adult decreased significantly with increasing temperatures within the temperature range of 15 C to 35 C temperature. The observed mean development times for all the immature life stages were fastest at 35 C  Egg  4.7   0.62  Larva  24.21   0.19  Pupa  7.72   0.73 , and lowest at 15 C  Egg  14.93   0.19  Larva  59.45   0.19  Pupa  23.83   1.28 . The cumulative frequencies of development times of each life stage and temperatures were plotted against normalized developmental times by fitting a complementary logit distribution curve for all stages. The best fit model was selected based on Akaike s Information Criterion  AIC , a well  known goodness of fit indicator. Inverse of durations of immature development and adult survival  1 days  were taken as rates of development and survival, respectively. The non linear regression model was fitted to establish the relationship between development rate and temperature. For describing the temperature dependence of development rate of immature stages, Logan 1 function was fitted for all the stages at various constant temperatures. The thermal reaction norms were well fitted by the Logan 1 model as indicated by the smallest value of AIC   49.34  and highest value of coefficient of determination  R2 0.99  for egg stage, for larvae and pupa with smallest value of AIC  Larva  AIC of  71.16  Pupa  AIC of  74.34  and highest value of coefficient of determination  Larva  R2 0.99  Pupa  R2  0.98 , respectively. The senescence rate for both the female and the male adults increased linearly from low to high temperatures. The modified fourteen parameter version of Sharpe and DeMichele model for male and female provided a good fit to the observed mean senescence rates for both the adult sexes. The temperature dependent mortality rates for egg and pupa of C. partellus were well fitted by the Polynomial 2 model as indicated by the smallest value of AIC  Egg  AIC    37.19  pupa  AIC    23.71  and highest value of coefficient of determination  Egg  R2   0.99  pupa  R2   0.90  respectively and for larval stage of C. partellus, Wang 7 model were well fitted as indicated by the smallest value of AIC     19.27  and highest value of coefficient of determination  R2   0.95 . The optimum temperature for survival of immature life stages of C. partellus are within the range of 25 to 300C   85  survival of all the immature stages . A non  linear regression model, Janisch and Analytis was fitted to find out the effects of various constant temperatures on total number of eggs produced by a female adult during her whole life span. Eggs were produced by females from temperature regimes between 15 35 C, with the minimum number of total eggs per female at 150C  147.20  and peak egg laying at 27 C  352.4  in their gonotrophic cycle. Egg laying was lowest at 15 C decreased with increase in temperature after 30 C, ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 23 indicating the unsuitability of temperatures below and above this range for its oviposition. The relationship between cumulative oviposition rate and female age was well described by the Gamma function. Life table parameters Using  stochastic simulation tool  in ILCYM which is based on rate summation and cohort up dating approach, the life table parameters viz., gross reproductive rate  GRR , net reproductive rate  Ro , intrinsic rate of natural increase  rm , finite rate of increase    , mean generation time  T  and doubling time  Dt  were estimated. Results indicated that these life table parameters of C. partellus varied significantly with temperature and were found to have cubic relationship with temperature. Finite rate of increase     which is the indicator of reproductive value of new egg was highest at 30 C and thereafter showed a negative relationship with temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase  rm , and finite rate of increase     increased with increase in temperature from 150C to 300C and decreased with increase in temperature. Intrinsic rate of increase  rm , varied from 0.015 females female day at 15 C to 0.14 females female day at 30 C. An increase in mortality with decrease or increase in temperature indicates the non linear relationship. The suitable range for C. partellus reproduction was observed between 25 30 C. C. partellus population attained a maximum net reproductive rate  Ro   215.66 females female  generation  and total fecundity  631.62 individuals  female generation  at 30 C temperature. After that the net reproductive rate and gross reproductive rate decreased with increase in temperature  at higher temperatures less fecundity was recorded. Values estimated for  T  indicate that the mean length of generations decreased from 97.27 days at 15 C temperature to minimum of 31.83 days at 35oC and shortest doubling time was observed at 35 C  15.26   0.05 days . Fitting of a polynomial model to the estimated life table parameters predicted temperatures between 27 30 C as a favourable range for C. partellus development, survival and reproduction, where high reproductive potential and shorter generation length were observed. From our findings it is understood that the  rm  and   increased with increase in temperature from 15 C and later started declining from 30 C with increase in temperature. Life table parameters of C. partellus estimated at six constant temperatures. Intrinsic rate of natural increase  a , Net reproduction rate  b , Gross reproductive rate  c , Mean generation time  d , Finite rate of increase  e , and Doubling time  f . ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 24 The average number of generations that C. partellus population can complete in a year under the current  2000  and the future  2050  climatic conditions are determined using the third module of ILCYM. The results indicated significant increase in activity index and establishment risk index at future  2050  climatic conditions compared to current climatic conditions. There is increase in the average number of generations of C. partellus population under future  2050  climatic conditions compared to the current  2000  climatic conditions. 2.3.14.

Effect of Ca bentonite on soil moisture dynamics and availability of nutrients in semi arid rainfed Alfisols Addition of Ca bentonite with high water holding capacity and during drought can be attempted specifically in the case of Alfisols, to improve maize yield. During this year a field experiment on different doses of Ca bentonite  150 200 mesh natural white colour  in maize crop conducted. Treatments includes T1 Control, T2 75   RDF , T3 100   RDF , T4  5 t Ca bentonite ha 75  RDF , T5 10 t Ca bentonite ha 75   RDF , T6 15 t Ca bentonite  ha 75   RDF , T7 20 t Ca bentonite ha 75   RDF , T8  5 t Ca bentonite ha 100  RDF ,T9 10 t Ca  bentonite ha 100   RDF , T10 15 t Ca bentonite  ha 100   RDF  and T11 20 t Ca bentonite  ha 100   RDF . Results showed that added levels of the Ca bentonite along with 75  RDF and 100  RDF improved the maize grain yield. The treatments 15 t Ca bentonite ha 75   RDF  and T10 15 t Ca  bentonite ha 100   RDF  found quite effective in improving the maize grain yield as compared to the rest of the treatments. Effect of different Ca bentonite doses and RDF on maize grain yield. Similarly, the water release pattern of soils plays a significant role crop production particularly during drought. In laboratory, water release curve for different Ca bentonite materials was developed. Water release pattern shows that it linearly releases the water as the pressure increase irrespective the Ca bentonite materials. Results indicates that the as size of the Ca  bentonite materials decreased the plant available water capacity increases. The highest plant water available capacity was observed with 150 200 mesh natural white colour Ca bentonite material. Water release curve for different Ca bentonite materials. 2.4.4. Characterizing preferential flow in soils of semi  arid Telangana In semi arid regions, the connecting aboveground and belowground processes to investigate how soil redistribute rainfall and nutrient and their impact on subsurface flow, is an overlooked phenomenon. Water balance depicts inflow to any water system or area is equal to its outflows plus change in storage during a time interval thus helps in deciding the length of growing period for a region. The Length of growing period for the micro watershed was 120 days. The growing period provides a framework for summarizing temporally variable elements of climate, which can then be compared with the requirements and estimated responses of the plant. Water balance diagram with Length of growing period and mean monthly temperature of the Hayathnagar micro watershed. Sorptivity is a component of the flow processes and needs to be incorporated in any application where adsorption or desorption of a fluid from a porous media is occurring due to a potential change at a ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 30 surface boundary.

Economic impact of livestock as means of livelihood security to resource poor dryland farmers The study examined the spatial and temporal trends in livestock endowment in the country and its contribution to farm household income in selected semi arid regions. The country, from 1951 to 2019, the compound annual growth rate of total bovines was 3.44 per cent while cattle it was 1.61 per cent and Buffalo had the highest growth of 8.19 per cent. The small ruminants are kept specifically in drylands for sustenance and sold as negative coping strategy. In the country the sheep population recorded a growth of 5.43 per cent and goat population of 9.5 per cent. The states under the arid and semi arid regions of the country had major share of small ruminants. 2.6.10. Agrarian distress and PMFBY  an analysis of rainfed agriculture To understand the impact of the different crop insurance schemes, this study probed crop condition, losses and claims from insurance in both normal year and bad year. The study also developed a Farmers Distress Index which comprises seven pillars as mentioned in the below figure to track distress at farmers level and identify sub districts  blocks  with severe distress for intervention. All the schemes are not responding to the natural calamities like droughts, pest and diseases losses. Farmers  incomes decreased greatly during the bad year  2021 22  when compared to a normal year  2020 21 . No other government or private schemes are working to alleviate distress during the bad year except crop insurance schemes like PMFBY and YSR  free crop insurance. Dimensions of agricultural distress 2.6.11. Adaptation targeting and prioritization for climate change An analysis of resilience of yield to drought showed considerable yield losses in soybean  7.05 q ha  and chickpea  7.42 q ha  during a drought year.

These adaptation technologies helped saved 58  an 44   of avoidable yield losses in these two crops. 2.6.12. Harnessing statistical tools for informed decision making towards sustainable rainfed agriculture New measure was developed for assessing sustainability of treatments  practices evaluated in long term experiments as Where is standard deviation in interaction effects of ith treatment over years  is average yield of ith treatment over years, and is maximum yield in the experiment. The measure was further improved by proposing two more estimators and developed a framework for assessing sustainability of treatments  practices evaluated in long term experiments. One measure was derived by regression of interaction residuals of a treatment in different years on environmental covariates such as rainfall, dry spells during the crop growing season. If adjusted R2 is positive the model gives uncertainty estimate less than . Similarly, another measure was developed by regression of interaction residuals of a treatment in different years on environmental index computed for a year as deviation of mean yield of all treatments in a year from overall mean. In this case too if adjusted R2 is positive the model gives uncertainty estimate less than . If adjusted R2 is negative for any treatment sustainability estimate for the treatment should be based on . Number of treatments with positive R2 may be considered as a criterion to determine whether the measure to be used should be based on environmental covariates or environmental index. 2.6.13. Enabling decision makers in technology transfer in rainfed agriculture through mobile based applications During this period, the developed mobile app unreaped yield potentials of major rainfed crops were updated accommodating 17 rainfed crops viz., rice, sorghum, pearlmillet, maize, fingermillet, chickpea, pigeonpea, blackgram, greengram, lentil, groundnut, soybean, sunflower, sesame, rapeseed, mustard, castor and cotton. The app provides climate and available water holding capacity  AWHC  of soil of the district, area under the crop and share of irrigated area and share of a particular season  in case of rice, sorghum, maize, blackgram and greengram  in area under the crop and yield of the district in the crop. It further provides yield achieved by model districts.

The impact of elevated carbon dioxide and temperature on crops, pests, diseases, weeds, soil, microbes, and livestock in the rainfed ecosystem. 3.1.1. Productivity of rainfed crops under enhanced carbon dioxide and its interaction with water deficit and elevated temperature The fast changes occurring in climatic parameters across the globe indicate that global warming is beginning to affect the different production systems including agriculture. A field experiment under Free Air Temperature Elevation  FATE  facility was conducted to assess the impact of elevated temperature  eT  and its interaction with elevated CO2  eT eCO2  on phenology, physiology, biomass and grain yield of four black gram  Vigna mungo  L.  Hepper  genotypes, IPU 06 2, PLU 826, PSRJ 95016, IPU 094 1. The eT was maintained at 3.0   0.5 C above ambient canopy temperature  aT  and eCO2 was maintained at 550   50 ppm. The elevated crop canopy temperature  eT  and eCO2 along with eT  eT eCO2  has minimum influence on the phenology of days to 50 percent flowering of black gram genotypes, except with IPU 094 1 where an earliness of 4 days was recorded under eT eCO2 condition. The eT reduced photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of all four black gram genotypes. Among the selected genotypes, IPU  06 2 registered the highest photosynthetic rate  Anet  under all three conditions. With elevated temperature  eT , the reduction in Anet ranged from nil  PSRJ  95016  to 16.55 percent  IPU 094 1 , while eT eCO2 condition improved it to better than at aT level from 27 percent  PLU 826  to 38 percent  PSRJ 95016 . The stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were reduced under both eT and eT eCO2 conditions, however, the magnitude of the response differed with genotype, and a higher reduction of these parameters was recorded with eT eCO2 than eT condition. The genotype PLU 826 registered higher WUE at both eT and eT eCO2 conditions due to better Anet and higher reduction in transpiration rate.

Impact of e CO2 and e Temp on growth, phenology, physiology and yield of potato  Solanum tuberosum L.  under CTGC Global climate change accompanied by continuous increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide  CO2  concentration and temperature affects the growth and yield of important crops. The study investigated the effect of elevated temperature and CO2 concentrations on the growth, yield, and photosynthesis of potato  Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Kufri Pukhraj  crop using Carbon dioxide and Temperature Gradient Chambers  CTGCs  facility that allows the regulation of ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 58 temperature and CO2 concentration in the chambers. The experiment was laid out 02 12 2022 to assess the impacts of elevated CO2 and temperature on growth, phenology and yield at HRF under CTGC chambers. The experiment was laid out with potato variety Kufri Pukhraj variety suitable for this location in CTGC chambers at HRF with four treatments.

Temperature gradient 5   0.5 C above reference with elevated CO2 concentration of 550   50 ppm    eTemp    eCO2. Data sets were being collected on plant height, number of branches, leaf area, biomass, photosynthesis, growth, stomatal conductance and chlorophyll concentrations, biomass, tuber yield, data on major insect pests are recorded and pest dynamics are being worked out. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide increased rate of photosynthesis leading to more carbohydrate Tubers initiation at 30 days after planting among the treatments Tubers formation at 60 days after planting among the treatments production and increased biomass. Increased CO2 was also responsible for physiological processes like changed respiration, reduced stomatal conductance, reduced transpiration rates and increased water use efficiency. Subsequent morphological changes observed are increased leaf area index, dry matter and ultimately enhanced potato tuber production. Increased temperature has a negative effect on growth and yield of potato plant. If the temperature increases above the optimum temperature of the plant it will decline photosynthesis. Sampling at 60 days revealed great variation in tuber formation and number of tubers per plant. The number of tubers per plant were more in combination of e temp   e CO2  8.5  plant  followed by 7.60  plant in e Temp, 5.6 plant in eCO2 and 5.2 plant in control. Tuber Yield  At harvest time, the tuber size, biomass, yield, and marketable yield of potatoes cultivated under varying CO2 concentrations and temperatures were analyzed. There were significant differences in the number of small    30 g , medium  30 80 g , and large    80 g  potatoes. The tuber size was greater under eCO2 than under the Control, eCO2  eTemp conditions and smallest under eTemp conditions. There was a significant difference in the total number of tubers per plant among the eCO2, eCO2  eTemp, eTemp conditions but was lower at the control conditions. Biomass was significantly affected by the treatment conditions, with the highest leaf, stem, and tuber biomass achieved under CO2 conditions. Tuber yield and marketable yields under different conditions ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 59 grown under eT, eCO2 and eT CO2  4 replications of each genotype from three treatments  conditions of FATE facility. Processed the black gram seed samples consisting of three treatments for estimation of essential nutrients and essential minerals  Fe and Zn . Zinc content was found to be reduced with eT treatment compared to control and the content showed slight improvement with the eT eCO2, presence of eCO2 reduced the high temperature effect to some extent. Similar response trend was also observed with Iron content reduction under eT condition as compared to ambient control, however the content was further reduced with eT eCO2 treatment in all black gram genotypes. Protein content     of seed was found to be reduced 2.5 percent in eT treatment compared to control and the content was slightly recovered with eT eCO2 condition in black gram genotypes. This could be due to the denaturation of protein as temperature increases. Among the black gram genotypes, PSRJ 95016 had lower protein content under ambient conditions and eT eCO2 as compared to the other genotypes. Zinc has direct relation with protein content, as decrease in zinc content affects protein content of black gram samples. 3.1.3. Assessment of Transpiration Efficiency  TE  of black gram genotypes under elevated CO2 and temperature  Black gram varieties  IPU  0602, PLU 826, PSRJ  95016, IPU 94 1  were grown under aT, eT, eT eCO2 in FATE facility during rabi to quantify the water transpired from seedling to maturity  grain harvest  and transpiration efficiency. Transpiration efficiency was determined by gravimetric method. The average biomass produced by four genotypes of black gram grown under aT, eT and eT CO2 conditions was 25.9, 22.82 and 26.87g  pl and seed yield was 9.37, 8.09 and 9.59 g pl respectively. The average water transpired was 6.85, 7.40 and 7.27 kg  plant under aT, eT and eT CO2 conditions respectively. The eT condition increased water transpired  kg pl  and decreased the biomass and seed yield  g pl  there by decreasing the TE biomass and TE seed in black gram as compared with ambient conditions. Average TE biomass under aT, eT and eT CO2 were 3.79, 3.08, 3.69 g kg and TE seed was 1.36, 1.09 and 1.32 g kg water transpired. eT  eCO2 improved the transpiration efficiency by decreasing transpiration and increasing TEbiomass and TEseed revealing the ameliorative response of eCO2 in the presence of eT.

Impact of eCO2 and eT on quality of crop residues as livestock feed The projected increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide  CO2  and climate change will have significant impacts on future fodder quality and productivity. A study was conducted to assess the impact of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide on quality, and in vitro digestibility of haulms of groundnut crop  K6 and Narayani varieties  grown in the FATE and FACE facility under three set of environmental conditions i.e., ambient temperature  aTemp , elevated temperature  eTemp  with 3 0.5 C and combination of eTemp and elevated CO2 of 550  50 ppm  eCO2  eTemp . Groundnut haulms were collected at 60 DAS in three replications from all the treatments and analyzed for proximate composition  organic matter, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre , fibre fractions  NDF, ADF, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin , minerals composition  Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn , in vitro dry matter digestibility  IVDMD  and metabolizable energy. Among the K6 and Narayani varieties, relatively higher ash, crude fibre  CF  crude protein  CP  was observed in Narayani, whereas higher In vitro dry matter digestibility  IVDMD  was observed in groundnut haulms of K6 variety and the differences were not significant. Higher  P 0.05  neutral detergent fibre  NDF , acid detergent fibre  ADF , lignin per cent were found in haulms of K6 variety of groundnut crop grown under elevated temperature  eTemp  environmental conditions. Organic matter, and crude protein were found highest  P   0.05  at the ambient  control  conditions. Growing groundnut crop under elevated carbon dioxide and temperature  eCO2 eTemp  environmental conditions increased  P   0.01  ash, crude fibre, hemicellulose and cellulose contents in haulms. In vitro dry matter digestibility  IVDMD  of haulms of groundnut crop grown under FATE and FACE facility differed significantly  P   0.05  among ambient temperature  control , elevated temperature  eTemp  and elevated carbon dioxide and temperature  eCO2 e Temp  chambers. Highest IVDMD in groundnut haulms was found in the groundnut crop grown at the ambient  78.6 0.17 , whereas lowest  74.2 0.21  under eTemp environmental conditions. Among different treatments, highest metabolizable energy  ME  was found in the haulms of groundnut crop grown at the ambient, followed by eCO2 eTemp, and eTemp environmental conditions. Except NDF and hemicellulose, a similar trend was observed in haulms of Narayani variety of groundnut crop. A non  significant difference has been observed in mineral composition in both the varieties of groundnut haulms. 3.1.6. Pest scenario of Helicoverpa armigera  Hub.  on pigeon pea during future climate change periods under RCP based projections in India Multi model ensemble of Maximum  Tmax  and Minimum  Tmin  temperature data of four Representative Concentration Pathways viz., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 of Coupled Model Inter comparison Project 5  CMIP5  models were generated for eleven major pigeon pea growing locations of the India to predict the number of generations of Helicoverpa armigera  Hub.  using growing degree days approach during three future climate viz., Near  NP , Distant  DP  and Far Distant  FDP  periods and were compared over 1976 2005 baseline period  BL . The studies indicated a significant increase in both temperatures in 4 RCPs. The increases were Quality of haulms of groundnut  Narayani var.  crop grown under different environmental conditions Quality of haulms of groundnut  K6 var.  crop grown under different environmental conditions ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 61 markedly higher and much evident in RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 during DP and FDP CCPs. It is expected that projected temperatures  Tmax and Tmin  would follow an increasing trend during 3 CCPs at 11 locations. Tmax  0.7 to 4.7 C  and Tmin  0.8 to 5.1 C  would increase considerably during NP, DP and FDP of 4 RCP scenarios. This trend was more evident in RCP 8.5 of FDP followed by 6.0 and 4.5 scenarios. Annual number of generations and generation time Significant  F 3, 3828   1768.82, P   0.001  differences were observed in annual number of generation of H. armigera on pigeon pea with reduced gen. time  F 3, 3828   1045.33, P   0.001  among RCPs with RCP 8.5  16.83   0.45  21.31  0.30  followed by RCP 6.0  15.70   0.34  22.75   0.15 , RCP 4.5  15.48   0.33  22.98   0.54  over RCP 2.6  14.79   0.29  24.25   0.19 . Increase in temperature causes the advancement of insect developmental stages which in turn results in reduction of duration of life cycle and thus more generations of insects may occur in shorter period of time. Our present findings showed that a greater number of annual generations of H. armigera on pigeon pea  6 to 38    would be in RCP 8.5 followed by 6.0, 4.5 over 2.6 RCPs. Shortened generation time was noticed in all four RCPs in calendar year  4 27 percent  and the trend was more evident in RCP 8.5 of FDP over BL.

Independent and interactive effects of eCO2 and eTemp. on primary parameters of Spodoptera frugiperda  J.E. Smith  on Maize Several experimental trials were laid out in the CTGC facility and a standard procedure was followed to conduct the feeding experiments. Insectary of ICAR CRIDA has an insect culture of S. frugiperda comprising all four stages of the life cycle. The treatment associations were maintained in conducting the feeding experiments by collecting the leaves from the respective CO2 and temperature conditions for the two successive generations. The weights of the larva, its leaf consumption, and the frass excreted were recorded. Larval life span was calculated as the period between the emergence of the larva from the egg till its pupation was considered as larval duration. Second generation feeding experiments of S. frugiperda were initiated using the first instar larvae hatched from the eggs laid by the first generation female adults. The data on primary parameters viz., weights of larvae, leaf consumption, and frass excreted were measured for both generations. Primary parameters Total consumption  eCO2  F 1, 63  44.99, P   0.01 , eTemp  F3, 63  6.91, P   0.01 , and interactive conditions of both  F3, 63  26.15, P   0.01  altered the total consumption of maize foliage by S. frugiperda larvae. Higher total consumption was at 33   1 C and eCO2  3765.5 mg   985 mg  against the lower at 28  1 C at aCO2  2781 mg   482 mg . Larval weight  Higher larval weights of S. frugiperda  547   42 mg  were at eTemp  33   1 C   F 3, 63  6.50, P   0.01  and eCO2 condition  F 1, 63  18.41, P   0.01  against the least at aTemp   aCO2  474.5   35 mg . The interactive mechanism of both dimensions  F 3, 63  2.82, P   0.01  also influenced the larval weights. Fecal matter  When the mean value of the fecal matter released by the larva for two generations was observed, the increase was found to be significant at eCO2  F1, 63  30.70, P   0.01 , eTemp  F3,63  7.50, P   0.01  and in turn reflected in their interactive result  F3, 63  16.56, P   0.01  also. At 28   1 C with eCO2, higher  1176 mg   85 mg  frass was released as against the lower  740 mg   55 mg  at the same temperature at aCO2.

Impact of eCO2 and eTemp on rhizo microbiome of black gram  Vigna mungo L.  and characterization of efficient Rhizobium strain s . Effect of Rhizobium isolates on nodulation and plant growth parameters of blackgram genotypes Rhizobium isolates such as Rhizobium BR11, Rhizobium BR16 and Rhizobium BR24 were tested for their effectiveness in nodulation and plant growth promotion of five black gram genotypes viz., IPU 06  02, PSRJ 95016, PLU 826, WBG 108 and IPU7 3. Inoculation of Rhizobium isolates was done through seed treatment. Differences in nodulation and other plant growth parameters like shoot length, root length, shoot fresh weight and root fresh weight were observed in black gram genotypes due to the inoculation of Rhizobium isolates. Inoculation of Rhizobium BR24 substantially enhanced the nodule numbers in IPU 06  02, PSRJ 95016, WBG 108 and IPU7 3 genotypes in comparison with uninoculated control. Similarly, Rhizobium BR11 markedly increased the nodule numbers in PLU 826 genotype. pinboards and spokes. The elevated CO2 resulted in reduced number of laterals  10  as compared to the treatments of ambient  13  and open field conditions  16 .

Soil plant water dynamics modelling under eCO2 and eTemp and varying rainfall intensities for rainfed crops Peak Rainfall Analysis for developing Intensity  Duration Frequency curves for RCP 4.6 The weather data for RCP 4.6 from 2020 2049 and the base data from 1971 to 2020 for Hayathnagar geo location, were analysed annual peak rainfalls to understand the behaviour of extreme rainfall patterns in the region. It was observed that during the base period of 50 years, there were common peak rainfall varying from 50 to 100 mm except in 2020 with 300 mm. However, during the period from 2020 to 2049  30 years , there were three peaks of rainfall varying from 150 to 300mm at an increment of 5 years alternatively happening in the time series. After mid year of RCP 4.6, the peak rainfall drastically reduced with the range of 50 to 100 mm  Fig. 1 and Fig. 2  indicating no regular pattern of peak rainfall in the region. The above weather peak data were analyzed using the IMD1 3 rule, probability analysis and frequency analysis using extreme Gumbel distribution, the Intensity  Duration and Frequency curves for Hayathnagar were constructed as presented in Fig 3 and Fig 4 for understanding the extreme rainfall intensities in the region. The peak rainfall was split into intensity for different durations  0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 hrs  for different frequencies  2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 . The analysis indicated that the intensities are maximum at all frequencies in RCP 4.6 having an increasing trend in the intensities for all time durations. The average increase observed in RCP 4.6 was 7.93 percent over the base period intensities. However, the maximum increase was observed in lower durations of 0.25, 0.5 and1 hr.

Maize equivalent yields increased with an increase in nitrogen application. 125 percent RDN recorded 44 percent higher maize equivalent yields as compared to no fertilizer application. Raised beds with CF  1.22  and paired row   CF  1.24  recorded higher LER as compared flat sowing with CF  1.08  or flat sowing without CF  1.11 . Potential role of in situ moisture conservation and nutrient management strategies for sustainable production and resource use efficiency in rainfed areas An experiment was initiated to study the efficacy of different in situ moisture conservation treatments and fertilizer on crop productivity and resource use efficiency in cotton. The lint yield of cotton was influenced by in situ moisture conservation and fertilizer treatments. CF at sowing recorded 31 and 30 percent higher yield as compared to flat sowing and live mulch respectively. CF at 30 DAS recorded higher yield as compared to flat sowing  live mulch. The higher yield in CF at sowing is due higher soil moisture in this treatment as compared to other treatments. The entire rainfall from sowing till harvest was utilized completely.

Adaptation and mitigation potential of millet based organic production systems in rainfed Alfisols Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing sectors of agricultural production, and is reported to have both climate change adaptation and mitigation potential particularly in rainfed agriculture. A field experiment was conducted during kharif 2022 at GRF of the institute to evaluate the performance of finger millet  Eleusine coracana    pigeon pea  Cajanus cajan   2 1 , foxtail millet  Setaria italica    pigeon pea  2 1  and little millet  Panicum sumatrense    pigeon pea  2 1  under organic, control  chemical  and integrated crop management systems. The experiment was laid out in a strip plot design with three production systems and three intercropping systems. In the plots under organic management, gliricida  harvested from research farm  was applied on the N equivalent basis to all the three cropping systems. In the plots under integrated management, 25 percent of equivalent recommended N  10 kg ha  was applied through gliricidia. The remaining 75 percent N  30 kg ha  and 100 percent P  20 kg ha  and K  20 kg ha  was applied through chemical fertilizers. The plots under control  chemical  received recommended dose of chemical fertilizers  40 20 20 kg NPK ha  for all the three intercropping systems. In the plots under organic management, no chemical herbicides, insecticides or fungicides were used, in keeping with organic standards. Weeds were controlled by manual weeding hoeing using a manually operated wheel hoe. Azadirachtin  Azadirachta indica based formulation  was sprayed as required during crop growth as a prophylactic measure against insect pests. In the plots under control  chemical , crop specific recommended herbicides and pesticides were sprayed for control of weeds, insect pests and diseases. In the plots under integrated management, recommended integrated pest management  IPM  modules were implemented. The crops experienced two dry spells of 14 days  9 22 August  and 10 days  12 21 September  coinciding with flowering and seed formation stages of millets Foxtail millet   pigeonpea  2 1  intercropping system under organic management Finger millet   pigeon pea  2 1  intercropping system under control  chemical  Little millet   pigeonpea  2 1  intercropping system under integrated management Performance of millet based intercropping systems under different production systems ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 68 and vegetative stage of pigeon pea. Further, pigeon pea seed yield was also less across different treatments due to occurrence of wilt and no rainfall during pod filling and maturity. In general, among the three intercropping systems, finger millet   pigeon pea  2 1  system produced 17.2 and 26.9 percent higher finger millet equivalent yield  FMEY   2199 kg ha  than foxtail millet   pigeon pea  2 1  and little millet   pigeon pea  2 1  systems, respectively. Among the production systems, averaged across three intercropping systems, organic and integrated management being on par with each other produced significantly higher FMEY than control  chemical . Similarly, both organic and integrated treatments produced similar but significantly higher FMEY of finger millet   pigeon pea  2 1  and foxtail millet   pigeon pea  2 1  systems compared to control. However, organic management recorded significantly higher FMEY compared to integrated management and control. 3.3.4. Genotyping of black gram for identifying diverse genetic materials Black gram or urd bean  Vigna mungo L. Hepper 2n   22 , a short duration pulse crop is cultivated mainly under rainfed conditions in India. The crop is often exposed to drought stress during crop season, drastically affecting production and productivity adversely affecting yield parameters such as pod number, seed number, seed weight, etc. Genetic enhancement for drought tolerance remains a major challenge for realizing higher productivity of this important crop for rainfed condition. A field experiment was conducted in kharif 2022 with 40 black gram genotypes under well watered and water  stressed conditions with a 2 row plot per genotype. The crop was sown with row to row distance of 45cm and, plant to plant distance of 10 cm. Data on various physiological traits were recorded under well watered and water stress conditions during a dry spell of 10 days which coincided with the pre flowering stage. The parameters recorded were SPAD chlorophyll meter reading  SCMR , normalized difference vegetation index  NDVI , canopy temperature depression  CTD , relative water content  RWC , Total chlorophyll content  Tchlo , total soluble sugar  TSS  and membrane stability index  MSI . The crop did not get expose to drought stress post flowering to physiological maturity, due to regular intermittent rains. As a result, phenological and yield parameters such as days to 50 percent flowering, days to maturity, plant height  PH , branches number  BN , cluster number  CN , pod length  PL , number of seeds per pod  SPP , number of pods  PN , pod weight  PW , hundred seed weight  HSW , fodder yield per plant  FY  and seed yield per plant  SY  were recorded as non stress conditions. The genomic DNA was isolated from young leaves of all the 40 genotypes at vegetative stage  15 20 days seedling  for using in SSR markers genotyping work. A set of 41 genomic and 36 EST based SSRs were used for genotyping these 40 genotypes. The SSR data was used to calculate the number of alleles  Na , gene diversity  H , polymorphism information content  PIC  using PowerMarker  v.3.25  software. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 11 using UPGMA statistical method with Nei, 1972 similarity index. Robustness of the node of the phylogenetic tree was assessed from 1000 bootstrap replicates. The analysis of variance showed significant variances due to genotype for various yield traits such as plant height, cluster number, pod number, pod weight, hundred seed weight, seed yield plant and fodder weight. The mean performance of the genotypes showed PDU1 as the highest yielder followed by IPU 96 7 and IPU 13 7 among genotypes evaluated. The physiological traits were significantly affected under water stress condition as compared to well watered conditions. The combined ANOVA for all physiological traits also showed significant variances due to treatment, genotype and treatment   genotype interaction. Among the genotypes evaluated, highest SCMR was recorded for IPU10 117 followed by IPU10 1 under well watered while, IPU10 21 and IPU96 06 under stress conditions respectively. Similarly, for CTD, IPU11 2, IPU96 06 for well watered  IPU9 16 and IPU99 168 under stress conditions. The highest MSI was observed IPU13 4 and IPU13 6 under well  watered, while, IPU94 1 and IPU94 4 under stress conditions. The MSI showed high variation both for well watered  28.10 to 66.60  and stress  34.91 to 68.00  conditions. Genotypes also showed high variation for relative water content ranging from 85.63 to 94.72 percent, and 67.13 to 88.48 percent under well watered and stress conditions respectively. The ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 69 highest RWC was recorded for genotypes IPU13 6, IPU9 16 under well watered, while, PSRJ95016 and IPU10 16 under stress conditions. Genotyping using SSRs revealed that all SSRs except one genomic as polymorphic. Genotyping using genic and genomic SSRs revealed 136 unique alleles with an average of 3.32 alleles per marker, while maximum seven allele were detected for genomic SSR GENSSR4 and genic SSR ESTSSR2. The the average polymorphic information content  PIC  value of 0.50 and range of 0.19 to 0.81 between genotypes. The pairwise genetic distances were used for clustering of black gram genotypes via a dendrogram with UPGMA method by using Mega 11 software which revealed four diverse clusters among 40 genotypes. 3.3.5. Assessment of nitrous oxide emissions from livestock urine deposited in grazed pastures during different seasons Ruminant excreta  dung pats and urine  deposited on grazed grasslands are a major source of the greenhouse gas  GHG  i.e., nitrous oxide  N2O . Currently, many countries use the IPCC default emission factor  EF  of 2 percent to estimate excreta derived N2O emissions. However, emissions can vary greatly depending on the type of excreta  dung or urine , soil type and timing of application. Urine patches and dung pats from grazing livestock create hotspots for production and emission of the nitrous oxide  N2O , and represent a large proportion of total N2O in many national agricultural greenhouse gas inventories. Assessed the effect of added cattle urine at a rate of 0.7 L urine m2 on Green House Gases  GHGs  emissions in general and nitrous oxide emissions in particular under low, medium and high pasture cover of the grazing area during rainy, winter and summer seasons at Hayath Nagar research farm. Mean daily temperature and relative humidity  RH  varied throughout the experimental period and ranged from 24.18 to 26.91 OC and 74.88 to 92.93 per cent  rainy season   24.0 to 30.8 OC and 49.0 to 68.9 per cent  winter season   33.1 to 38.2 OC and 34.0 to 44.0 per cent  summer season , respectively during the experimental period. The differences in mean nitrous oxide values among the different time intervals  0,15, 30 and 45 minutes  were significantly  P 0.05  different. Nitrous oxide emissions were significantly  P 0.05  higher in low pasture cover experimental plots than high pasture cover plots. Nitrous oxide  N2O  emissions were significantly  P 0.01  higher in cattle urine applied experimental plots than control. Cumulative N2O emission flux from the urine applied plots differed significantly  P 0.05  and were higher under low, followed by medium and high pasture blocks of the experimental field in all the seasons. Similarly, cumulative N2O emission flux from the control plots without urine application were 0.71, 0.63 and 0.59 kg N ha 1, respectively during rainy, winter and summer seasons. Cumulative N2O emissions from with urine application were 3.92, 3.42 and 1.18 kg N ha 1, respectively under low pasture blocks of the experimental field during rainy, winter and summer seasons. Similarly, 3.40, 2.04 and 1.04 in medium and 2.38, 1.86 and 0.92 kg N ha 1, respectively under high vegetation pasture blocks of the experimental field during rainy, winter and summer seasons. Cumulative N2O emissions from the control plots without urine application were 0.95, 0.79 and 0.70 kg N ha 1, respectively under low, medium and high pasture blocks of the experimental field. Mean nitrous oxide  N2O  emissions factor     of low, medium and high pasture blocks of the experimental field was 0.61, 0.52 and 0.38, respectively.

Bio physical and socio  economic aspects of climate resilient technologies 3.4.1. Adaptation targeting and prioritization for climate change An analysis of resilience of yield to drought showed considerable yield losses in soybean  7.05 q ha  and chickpea  7.42 q ha  during a drought year. Adaptation interventions viz., change of variety in soybean and foliar spray in chickpea helped reduce yield losses to 2.95 and 4.17 q ha, respectively and enhancing yield resilience to 0.75  0.56 with no adaptation  and 0.32  0.21 with no adaptation  in soybean and chickpea, respectively. These adaptation technologies helped saved 58 and 44 percent of avoidable yield losses in these two crops. Efforts are therefore needed to scale out adoption of such adaptation technologies.

Assessing impact of climate change on major rainfed crops and constructing agro climatic analogues for adaptation Assessed future climate at district level. Climate projections of multi model ensemble for Precipitation, Max T and Min T at daily scale for 2050s and 2080s for RCP 8.5 scenario of CMIP 5 models at district level were used in the study. Computed Potential Evapotranspiration  PE  at district level using Hargreaves method from Max T and Min T data. These PE estimates were calibrated using FAO recommended Penman Monteith method as standard. Computed moisture index from P and PE and assessed climate at district level  Arid, Semi arid, Dry sub humid, Moist sub humid, Humid and Per humid . Compared to baseline of 1976 2005, climatic shifts are observed in 45 districts  8.62 percent of the geographical area in the country  in 2050s and 87 districts  15.33 percent of the geographical area in the country  in 2080s as per RCP 8.5.

Adoption dynamics and institutional drivers for scaling out resilience enhancing technologies Understanding of adoption diffusion dynamics and drivers that promote or constrain scaling up of Climate Resilient Agricultural  CRA  Technologies is essential. The study was conducted with the objective to identify the drivers that promote or constrain scaling up of CRA Technologies. Already introduced CRA technologies  interventions across different NICRA KVKs shall be studied for assessing the Adoption dynamics and drivers. Data collected from farmers from Ahmednagar KVK villages in Maharashtra. 101 adopted and 48 non  adopted farmers form the sample of the study. The data were collected using a pre tested interview schedule and focus group discussion guides from the farmers. Both household and village interview schedules are prepared for the purpose. Frequency, percent analysis, means, standard deviation, t test etc. will be employed for data analysis. Data analysis and final report shall be prepared based on the interpretation of results. Maximum adoption is observed for Silage bags to cows at 86 percent followed by Integrated Disease Management in Pomegranate at 78 percent  Change of variety in Soybean  Phule Sangam  at 75 percent, Mineral mixture to cow, sheep and goat at 73percent  and IPM  FAW  in Maize at 66 percent in that order respectively. It is obvious that with much focus on dairying and milk production in the villages surveyed, maximum adoption is observed for Silage storing in bags. Results indicate that information  as nature of support  about technology, it s availability, usage and benefits was provided at the highest level by KVK staff to the farmers in the above surveyed villages. Further, livestock related support and inputs were provided at the second highest level to the farmers by the KVK, Ahmednagar. This was followed by inputs in the form of new seed varieties, fodder varieties and poultry chick s distribution to the farmers. Data collection from another NICRA KVK to study above Adoption results shall be taken up. 3.5. Theme V. Development of IT based tools for climate change research 3.5.1. District wise adaptation strategies in rainfed maize under projected climate Future climate data derived from 30 general circulation models were used in DSSAT CERES Maize model to quantify the impact of projected climate on yield of rainfed maize in 16 major growing districts of the country. In the future, there is a projection of significant increase in mean seasonal maximum  0.9 6.0 C  and minimum temperatures  1.1 6.1 C . Climate change will lower maize yield by 16 per cent  Tumkur  to 46 per cent  Jalandhar  under RCP 4.5 and 21 per cent  Tumkur  to 80 per cent  Jalandhar  under RCP 8.5 from the baseline period, if adaption measures are not taken up. Only in Dharwad, the yield will be marginally greater or unchanged. The effectiveness of a combination of six adaptation measures delayed sowing by two weeks, an increased dose of nitrogen fertilizer i.e., 150 kg ha 1, additional irrigation  one irrigation of 50 mm during either vegetative state  10 30 days after sowing  or reproductive stage  45 55 days after sowing , was better than the individual measures. For each of the future scenarios, district specific adaption techniques were identified.

In all the permutations best accuracy values 56 percent was obtained with limited image dataset at image resolution 512 pixels, the optimisation algorithm is SGD, ReLU activation function and the batch size is 32. VGG 16 Network 3.6. Technology Demonstration Component  TDC  Technology Demonstration Component  TDC  of NICRA aims at enhancing resilience and adaptive capacity of farmers and minimizing the impact of climate variability in risk prone districts of the country. The programme also aims at building capacity of farmers and to generate awareness on climate resilient agriculture and enable communities to respond to climate stresses in a continuous manner. It is being implemented in 151 village clusters representing 28 states and 5 union territories during 2022. As part of the programme, several technologies were demonstrated for enhancing their adoption. During the year, the program was implemented in farming system perspective by ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 73 dividing the village in to different typologies and by demonstrating suitable technologies for each of the typology to minimize the impact of climatic stresses. At several locations, the predominant farming system typologies are the rainfed and irrigated systems with and without the animal component. The impact of technologies in various typologies is given below  3.6.1. Performance of interventions 3.6.1.1. Performance of interventions in rainfed systems without animal component In the NICRA village of Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, rainfed systems are predominant. Farmers were demonstrated with drought tolerant bajra variety HHB 299 followed by mustard variety which can be sown early. Though normal rainfall was received during the kharif season, but rainfall was deficit during the August month. Bajra  HHB 299  produced higher yield up to 20  and additional income of Rs. 6,500 ha 1 compared to non NICRA farmers. High yielding mustard variety DRMRIJ 31 completed life cycle early and escaped the high temperatures at the time of harvesting. The variety produced an additional yield of 2.9 q ha 1 and net income of Rs. 17,600 ha 1 compared to non NICRA farmers. Drought tolerant varieties of bajra and mustard in NICRA village of Bharatpur district During the year 2022, deficit rainfall of 78  in June, 51  in July and 35  in August was received in NICRA village of Tenar, Garhwa district of Jharkhand. An amount of 553 mm  38  deficit  rainfall was received during kharif season in 43 rainy days. Delayed onset of monsoon was observed in the NICRA village delaying the sowing of kharif crops. To overcome the situation, drought tolerant rice variety IR64  DRT  1 , finger millet variety A 404 and niger variety Birsa Niger 3 were demonstrated to farmers. The drought tolerant varieties produced higher yields up to 39  with additional net income of Rs. 7,376 14,544 ha 1 compared to non NICRA farmers.

Flood tolerant rice variety in Sadanandapur NICRA village of Buxar district of Bihar 3.6.1.2. Performance of interventions in rainfed systems with animal component Based on the constraints and resources available in the NICRA villages, suitable interventions were identified for rainfed systems with animal component. Under this typology, focus was on crops and animal related interventions which can minimize the yield loss due to climate stress. For example, in Dholikhera NICRA village of Bhilwara district of Rajasthan, which is frequently prone to drought, kharif season received 800 mm rainfall of which 46  was deficit during the June month and a dry spell of 12 days in the September month coinciding with grain filling stage of the crop was observed. Drought tolerant and short duration varieties of maize  DHM 121 , blackgram  PU 01 , sorghum  CSV 15  and intercropping systems of maize   blackgram  DHM 121   PU 01  in 2 2 ratio were demonstrated. The varieties produced higher yield up to 42  compared to local varieties and obtained net income of Rs. 21,000 to 40,000 ha 1. The intercropping system obtained higher yields up to 35  compared to sole crop of maize crop with local variety. Drought tolerant and short duration varieties of maize  DHM 121 , blackgram  PU 01 , sorghum  CSV 15  demonstrated in NICRA village of Bhilwara district of Rajasthan ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 75 In case of animals, backyard poultry breed, Pratapdhan was introduced which can produce more number of eggs per year with high meat production. Additional income of Rs. 40,000 was obtained from Pratapdhan breed compared to Marwari local bird. In Chandauna village of Darbhanga district of Bihar, 226 mm rainfall was received during kharif season of which 39 mm was received during June, 53 mm in July and 70 mm in August. Direct seeding of rice  DSR  method was demonstrated for taking up timely sowing as the district received deficient rainfall during the year. The soaked seeds were directly sown in the field without nursery raising and water saving. Demonstrations were taken up in 40 farmer s fields. The DSR resulted in 15  higher yield and 38  higher net returns over transplanting method in comparison to non NICRA farmers. To improve the productivity in animals, pusa mineral mixture was demonstrated. Mineral mixture demonstration was taken up involving 20 cow rearing farmers and 27 goat rearing farmers. Cow feeding with pusa mineral mixture   50g day resulted in 23  higher milk productivity with additional net income of Rs. 30,000. Whereas, goat feeding with mineral mixture supplementing with vitamins and minerals has produced 8  higher meat productivity resulting in higher net income of Rs. 3,300  animal. Demonstration of Pratapdhan chicks in Dholikhera village, Bhilwara district of Rajasthan DSR method of rice cultivation and mineral mixture for goat in Chandauana village of Darbhanga district 3.6.1.3. Performance of interventions in irrigated systems with animal component Recurrent flood situation is experienced in Piprarhi NICRA village of Sitamarhi district of Bihar. During the year 2022, an amount of 968 mm rain was received during kharif season, about 33  excess rainfall was received during June. Flood situation prevailed in the month of July and August. To minimize the impact of flood situation, submergence tolerant variety Swarna Sub 1 was demonstrated to the farmers. The variety produced higher yield up to 38.2 q ha 1 compared to local rice variety 35.5q ha 1, an additional net income of Rs. 10,000 ha 1 was realized form the variety. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 76 Terminal heat is a major climatic stress encountered in many areas of Punjab in 2022, which has a significant effect on wheat production. Maximum temperatures were higher by 4 5 C during the third and fourth weeks of March 2022, and warmer temperatures persisted for two weeks. The introduction of resilient technologies such as direct seeded rice with short duration varieties followed by wheat sowing in time, adoption of happy seeder and super seeder, in situ rice residue management has improved the wheat yield upto 12  with additional net income of Rs. 25,000 ha 1 and had greatly reduced the effect of heat stress.

Performance of interventions in irrigated systems with animal component Creation of new water harvesting structures in convergence with the developmental programmes was taken up in Juna patrasar NICRA village of Barmer district of Rajasthan for harvesting the rain water. The harvested water was utilized for irrigating the rabi and summer crops contributing to cropping intensification Water harvesting and providing supplemental irrigation to cumin crop and napier grass in NICRA village of Barmer district of Rajasthan ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 77 in rainfed areas. Rabi crop cumin variety  GC 4  was introduced in the NICRA village which is having wilt tolerant ability and also high yielding. The variety is demonstrated in 20 farmers  field covering 10 ha area. About 2 3 irrigations were provided from the harvested water to the cumin crop. To enhance the animal productivity green fodder variety of napier grass i.e., Rajka bajri was demonstrated under irrigated conditions. Higher yields upto 6 q ha 1 and net income of Rs. 1,03,746 ha 1 was realized due to cumin and higher green fodder production of 163 q ha 1 with net income of Rs. 5,437 ha 1 was realized compared to non  NICRA farmers. Khanabari NICRA village of Kishanganj district of Bihar, generally experience flood situations in lowland and medium land conditions. During 2022, June month received higher rainfall with intense rainfall events of 35 132 mm day leading to water logging conditions of fields. Submergence tolerant rice variety Sabour Sampann was demonstrated to reduce the impact of flooding and for timely transplanting. The variety tolerates the submergence conditions and matures early in 75 days to escape the flooding at the time of harvesting. The variety recorded higher yield up to 11  with additional income up to Rs. 7,500 ha 1. To provide additional income to the household backyard poultry was introduced with Kadaknath chicks. Introduction of improved breeds helped to obtain additional body weight by 1.5 kg per bird and also increased the egg production by 41 per bird per year compared to local breeds. Demonstration of submergence tolerant rice variety Sabour Sampann and Kadaknath chicks for backyard poultry in NICRA village of Kishanganj district of Bihar During the year 2022, terminal heat stress prevailed over several parts of Uttar Pradesh. During the third and fourth week of March 2022 maximum temperatures were higher by 3 4oC over the normal temperature which impacted yields of wheat. To minimize the impact of heat stress technologies such as mulching in sugarcane, zero till sowing of wheat enabled timely sowing, heat tolerant wheat variety DBW 173, Raj 4120 and Raj 4079 were demonstrated in NICRA villages of Gonda, Kushinagar and Jhansi districts. The technologies have contributed to 94 95  of normal yields and minimized the yield loss. In livestock, feeding with green fodder, concentrates and mineral mixture   50 g day along with providing shade has reduced the impact of heat stress on animals and minimized the loss in milk yield compared to farmers  practice.

All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology  AICRPAM  The All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology  AICRPAM  was initiated by ICAR in May 1983 with the establishment of a coordinating cell at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad with 12 Cooperating Centres at various State Agricultural Universities. After a detailed review and evaluation of the progress made by the project and realizing the importance of agrometeorological research support for enhancing food production, ICAR enhanced the Cooperating Centres to additional 13 Agricultural Universities of the country w.e.f. April 1995. The 25 Cooperating Centres of the AICRPAM network are Akola, Ananthapuramu, Anand, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Chatha, Dapoli, Faizabad, Hisar, Jabalpur, Jorhat, Kanpur, Kovilpatti, Ludhiana, Mohanpur, Palampur, Parbhani, Raipur, Ranchi, Ranichauri, Samastipur, Solapur, Thrissur, Udaipur and Vijayapura. The Quinquennial Review Team has reviewed the research progress of the project in 1992, 1998 99, 2006, 2011 and 2017. In the last QRT Report, the performance of AICRPAM was adjudged as Very Good. 4.2.1. Research activities at Project Coordinating Unit Dry Spell Index  DSI  The dry spells within the crop season, along with cumulative rainfall deficit, play a vital role in determining the productivity of various rainfed crops in India. A new index named Dry Spell Index  DSI  was developed to quantify the cumulative impact of dry spells during the kharif season  Jun Sep  on major rainfed crops of India. District wise spatial variability and trends of DSI were analyzed across major arid and semi arid regions of the country using observed rainfall data from 1636 stations over six states of India. A comparison of DSI with the Standardized Precipitation Index  SPI , hitherto, a widely used drought index was also carried out to assess the comparative performance of DSI over SPI. Location map of 25 Cooperating centers and Project Coordinating Unit of AICRPAM Rainfall stations  indicates as dots  across the study area The results revealed that regions especially central and eastern Karnataka, northern Rajasthan and western Gujarat are becoming wetter in terms of total seasonal rainfall as indicated by SPI, and simultaneously becoming drier in terms of total dry spell duration within the season as per DSI. The impact of DSI on the yield of major rainfed crops viz., cotton, groundnut, maize, pearl millet, pigeon pea and sorghum was estimated by employing appropriate statistical methods. From the correlation analysis of DSI and SPI, it was observed that the impact of the number and duration of dry spells integrated in the form of DSI was higher in comparison to the influence ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 88 MTC and SWB methods were statistically compared and subsequently appropriate threshold values were identified to find the onset in 19 AERs of India. This study revealed that the onset is not influenced by threshold combinations in the per humid, humid and sub humid regions, whereas, in semi arid and arid regions, the critical evaluation of criteria for determining onset is vital to avoid false starts and undefined onset years. 4.3. Theme wise salient research findings from cooperating centres 4.3.1. Agro climatic characterization   A study on vegetation responses to meteorological drought in agricultural fields at different stations of Gujarat indicated that no significant association exist between SPEI and NDVI at Anand. This suggests crop conditions have a low dependency on monsoon wetness. However, at Bhuj, the vegetation condition of crop fields was found to be significantly responsive to the wetness of September  SPEII and SPEI2  and agricultural crop conditions during kharif and rabi seasons near Bhuj, largely dependent on the wetness of August and September months.   A comprehensive drought analysis based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index  SPEI  was carried out to find out its spatial variability over three dry zones of south Karnataka. Results showed that, the districts like Mandya, Tumkuru, Ramanagara, Davanagere and Chitradurga, drought events with higher magnitude  SPEI 2.05, 1.65, 1.54, 1.54 and 1.18, respectively  compared to other districts.   Changes in the area under different kharif and rabi crops and climatic parameters in the Punjab state during two major periods viz. green revolution period  1971 1990  and post green revolution period  1991 2018  were carried out. The study indicates no significant change in maximum temperature during pre  and post  green revolution time scales. But, increase and decrease in annual, kharif and rabi season minimum temperature and rainfall was evident during post green revolution period. of total rainfall indicated by SPI on the yield of six major rainfed crops in India. Groundnut and pearl millet crops were found to be experiencing a higher duration of dry spells in comparison to other crops. It was also noticed that districts with higher DSI showed lower productivity in all the crops compared to the districts with lower values of DSI having better productivity levels. Agroclimatic onset of crop growing season in various agro ecological regions of India The success of rainfed crop production is highly dependent on timely sowing planting decisions. Information on the optimum crop sowing window for the season will facilitate crop planning by farmers and other stakeholders. Daily rainfall data of 0.25  x 0.25  grid resolution from India Meteorological Department for the period 1951 2019 was used for the present study and gridded data was converted into area weighted daily rainfall data for 680 districts using the Thiessen polygon method. To determine the onset of crop growing season, three methods viz., Soil Water Balance, Depth and modified Morris and Zandesta were evaluated to identify the most suitable method. Soil Water Balance  SWB  method was found to be the most suitable based on validating with observed crop sown status, a false start and a number of undefined onset years criteria. The onset dates determined by Mean onset of the growing season determined by Modified Threshold Combination method ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 89   At Mohanpur Center, an attempt was made to find the accuracy and reliability of Hargreaves Samani, Turc and Makkink PET methods against the FAO Penman  Monteith method. The Makkink method could efficiently estimate PET with the least error and deviation compared to the other two methods.   At Samastipur, short  5 7 days  as well as long  11  15 days  dry spells during June September months were found to increase in the recent period  1998  2018  at Pusa, Samastipur, Purnia, Bhagalpur and Patna compared to earlier period  1979 1998 .   A significant increase in rainy days was observed in the districts like Dhule, Ahmednagar, Satara and Kolhapur districts while a significant decreasing trend was noticed in Nandurbar, Pune and Solapur districts. The remaining districts did not show any significant change during the period June  September. 4.3.2. Crop weather relationship studies   At Mohanpur, Among the growing environments, the crop transplanted on 23 June recorded the highest grain yield and RUE, followed by the crop transplanted on 20 July. Among the varieties, the highest yield and RUE was recorded by Nayanmani followed by Satabdi and Swarna.   The relationship of seasonal rainfall, available soil moisture with pear millet yield  2018 2021  at Anand indicated that seasonal rainfall of about 700 800 mm and 65 70  available moisture are optimum for maximum productivity. Rainfall higher than 800 mm during the season and more than 70  of mean available moisture reduced the production of pearl millet drastically.   A study on the effect of growing environments and cultivars on Leaf Area Index  LAI  at Hisar revealed that the crop attained maximum LAI at 35 DAS at the flag leaf stage and decreased thereafter. The maximum LAI was recorded by crop sown on 23 July  5.68  followed by that of 15 July  5.51 . Among varieties, the maximum LAI was recorded by HHB 272  5.50  followed by GHB 558  5.38 .   At Solapur, a pooled analysis to assess the effects of growing environments on radiation use efficiency  RUE  was studied using experimental data conducted during 2016 2021. Among the treatments, Dhanshakti sown during the second fortnight of July recorded the highest RUE at 50  flowering  2.4 g MJ 1 , followed by Mahyco hybrid  2.3 g MJ 1 .   At Ananthapuramu, BRG 1 recorded a significantly higher pod yield  644.8 kg ha 1  as compared to BRG 2, BRG 5 and PRG 176  568.1, 426.5 and 398.9 kg ha 1, respectively .   A similar correlation study conducted at Jabalpur indicated a negative correlation exhibited between maximum and minimum temperatures and bright sunshine hours with seed yield at the vegetative stage and pod development stages.   Bt cotton Balwan recorded a significantly higher seed cotton yield  1019 kg ha 1  than hirsutum cotton AKH 081  859.50 kg ha 1  and arboreum cotton AKA 7  767 kg ha 1  at Akola. Thermal use efficiency was found to be higher for monsoon  sown crop  28 June  with respect to both seed cotton and biomass production and it decreased in subsequent late sowing.   The crop sown on 06 November recorded the highest RUE  1.08 g MJ 1 m 2  than on 22 November  0.96 g MJ 1 m 2  and 06 December  0.71 g MJ 1 m 2  sown crop at 120 days after sowing at Chatha. Among the varieties, RUE increased from 30 to 120 DAS and the variety HD 2967 recorded the highest RUE  1.04 g MJ 1 m 2  followed by RSP  561  0.88 g MJ 1 m 2  at 120 DAS.   The impact of growing environments  01 Nov, 10 Nov, 20 Nov, 30 Nov and 10 Dec  and spacing  60 x 20 cm, 75 x 20 cm and 45 x 20 cm  on absorbed PAR of rabi maize was studied during rabi 2021 22 at Samastipur. Silking stage of the crop absorbed the highest PAR  931.2  m m 2 sec 1 , followed by tasselling stage  867.0  m m 2 sec 1 . The highest absorption was recorded by the crop sown on 30 November and the lowest by 1 November sown crop.   The effect of minimum temperature during the grain development stage and minimum temperature during the vegetative stage on the grain yield of rabi sorghum at Kovilpatti was studied. An increase in minimum temperature   21.4  C  during the grain development stage ultimately increases the grain yield of sorghum. ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 90   At Akola, crop sown on 02 November  D1  recorded higher heat use efficiency  0.99 kg ha 1 oC day 1  with respect to both seed and biomass production. Amongst the varieties, heat use efficiency with respect to grain yield and biomass production was higher in V1  JAKI 9218 .   Among the three microclimatic regimes studied  sown on 20 Sept., 25 Sept. and 30 Sept. 2021  at Jorhat, the highest yield was recorded under MR I  889.7 kg ha 1  followed by MR II  811.3 kg ha  1  and least in MR III  791.1 kg ha 1 . A decrease in seed yield was observed when sowing was done during the last week of September month.   At Mohanpur, the highest seasonal evapotranspiration was recorded for crop sown on 07 October, which might have reduced the water use efficiency of the varieties. The highest water use efficiency was recorded by cv. Meha sown on 25 September, followed by PM 05 sown on 25 September.   Effect of growing environments  D1  16 Nov., D2  22 Nov., D3  30 Nov. and D4  7 Dec. 2021  on chlorophyll content index  CCI  of potato varieties  V1  Kufri Bahar, V2  Kufri Pushkar and V3  Kufri Lima  was studied at Hisar. Among the different growing environments, the highest CCI was recorded by early planted crop i.e. D1  96.9  and lower by subsequent plantings. Among the varieties, Kufri Pushkar recorded the highest CCI value  92.3  followed by Kufri Lime  91.3  and lowest by Kufri Bahar  86.1 .   The impact of weather parameters on the yield of Alphonso mango at different locations of Maharashtra was undertaken by the Dapoli centre. During vegetative stages, evening relative humidity showed a significant positive relation with fruit yield. During fruiting, Tmax, BSS and pan evaporation showed a significant positive correlation and both morning and evening relative humidity showed negative relation.   Correlation of fruit yield and quality parameters of guava variety Hisar Safeda with weather parameter under Hisar condition  pooled data analysis, 2013  14 to 2021 22  indicated that average fruit yield  plant showed a significant positive correlation with saturation vapour pressure  both morning and evening  and negative correlation with seasonal rainfall. Total soluble solids  TSS  showed a significant positive correlation with relative humidity  morning and evening  and water use efficiency. The acid content of the fruit showed a significant negative correlation with morning and evening relative humidity and seasonal rainfall. 4.3.3. Crop growth modelling   The soybean model in DSSAT CSM was calibrated and validated for new soybean cultivars  JS 335, JS 9305 and AMS 1001  by the Akola centre. The impact of protective irrigation  60 cm  during long dry spells on the yield of soybean was simulated and the yield gain through simulated protective irrigation was of greater magnitude in late sown soybean and more so at the reproductive development stage of pod formation to seed development across all sowings.   Crop simulation model CERES millet was calibrated using 2017 experimental crop and weather data at Anand and validated with four years of field data of 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The model is predicting the phenology, biomass yield and final grain yields well within the limits. The D index values showed for anthesis, maturity days, LAI, grain yield and above ground biomass were 0.97, 0.99, 0.99, 0.91 and 0.91, respectively.   Seven years of weather data of different parameters and crop experimental data sets  rabi 2015 16 to 2021 22  were collected and analyzed at Chatham centgre, Jammu to develop the wheat yield prediction model. Step wise regression model indicated that the step 3 regression model with weather parameters at different growth stages  Tmax, Tmin, RH II, sunshine hours and evaporation  improved the accuracy of prediction up to 56 per cent. 4.3.4. Weather effects on pests and diseases   The relationship between weather and the incidence of spotted pod borer  Maruca vitrata  on red gram during 2019, 2020 and 2021 was studied at the Ananthapuramu centre. The correlation analysis for the rainfed crop indicated that there was a significant negative correlation between no. of webs per square meter and live larvae per square meter with rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum ICAR CRIDA Annual Report 2022 91 temperature, wind speed and evaporation and a significant positive correlation with morning relative humidity.   A simple weather based disease prediction model for cotton leaf curl virus disease was developed by the Hisar centre. The optimum range of weather parameters with the progression of maximum PDI value from 22 to 45 SMWs was analyzed and found to be 32.3 to 36.3 oC  maximum temperature , 24.5 to 29.6 oC  minimum temperature  and 73.2 to 86.7.0 per cent  morning relative humidity  and 7.0 to 9.1 hrs  bright sunshine hours .   An investigation was undertaken on the occurrence of haemo protozoan disease especially Theileriosis, Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis and viral disease Foot and Mouth Disease  FMD  in livestock at Ranchi district by using the retrospective data from the period 2012 2020. The average percentage disease incidence of Theileriosis and Babesiosis in cattle was significantly highest in monsoon  44.8  and 45.3   followed by summer  32.8  and 36.5   and lowest in winter  22.4  and 18.2  , respectively. Prevalence of Anaplasmosis was significantly highest in summer  47.9   followed by monsoon  33.5   and lowest in winter  18.6  . Cattle was more susceptible to FMD in the winter season during which, the average percentage of disease incidence was 42.8  followed by monsoon  32.8   and lowest in the summer season  24.4  . 4.3.5.
