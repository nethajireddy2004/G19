       "  'text': '36 Average income of STs was the lowest, followed by OBC, SC and highest among FCs (Figure 6.3).  However, income gap among social groups is less than the gap between marginal and large land-class. It  indicates that, the social group as an indicator of economic status is losing relevance, while landholding  size playing a major role in higher incomes.  Figure 6.3: Sources of income by social group Among all social groups, ST households received the lowest share of income from agriculture (49.8 per  cent of total income), which was followed by SCs (60.4 per cent of total income) as against the 71.4 per  cent for FC households. Also, income from the livestock rearing is higher in the other caste group at 7.1  per cent and is the lowest for scheduled tribe at 2.8 per cent. Although agriculture is main source of income (71 per cent) for only FC/OC household present in the  sample, a good chunk of income is also coming from non-farm employment, which is highest among the  all the groups (21.4 per cent of total income). While non-farm incomes not crossed even 5 per cent for  all other social groups with lowest for the backward class at 2.8 per cent and for scheduled castes at 4.8  per cent. The large chunk from non-farm income for FC household, may be due to their higher level of  education and also assets and capabilities to start and build non-farm income sources like petty business  or engagement in contracts, etc. Whereas, the SCs, STs and OBCs lack those networks, capabilities like  initial human and physical capital to take advantage of non-farm employment. Almost 20 per cent of  the earnings of STs and SCs are received from MGNREGA. Off farm income is significant among STs  (off-farm income encompasses all agriculture-related activities that occur beyond the farm. Examples  of off-farm income and enterprise include processing, packaging, storage, transportation distribution,  and retail sale). Apart from STs and SCs, MGNREGA contributes to the income of OBCs significantly  at 14.3 per cent. However, involvement of FCs in MGNREGA activities is limited (Table 6.2).

The past experience shows that about 5-6 years of  farming experience is sufficient for almost all agricultural operations in more efficient way, more  experience also indicates that perpetuation in old agricultural practices, not inclined for change to new  and improved methods of agriculture. Most of the sample households have been involved in agriculture  for about 19 years (Figure 5.10), which indicates experience is not a constraint for adopting good  agricultural practices. On the other hand, a farmer with more than 15 years of experience habitual to do  only old agricultural practices, motivating him to adopt new and improved agricultural practices require  more efforts from the extension agencies and scientists. SC farmers on an average have about 20 years  of experience, while lowest is among STs with only 14 years of experience. Although farmers are still  using old type of ploughs, bullock carts, sickles (single-handed agricultural tool designed with variously  curved blades and typically used for harvesting) etc., they are also adopting new technology especially  fertilizers, pesticides, crop varieties (especially cotton), if they found useful and simple to use.  Most of the farmers own only drylands with minimal investments in agriculture. The average investment  per household was just Rs. 21,218/acre (Figure 5.10). Investment by SC households is little less than  all other households. However, there is no significant difference across the social groups in terms of  investment per acre. There is significant difference in investment per acre and also years of experience  in farming across land size class. The marginal farms are being tilled for 18 years with an average  investment of Rs. 20,800 with at least one family member of the sample households and a minimum of  two persons are engaged on small and medium farms with an average investment of Rs. 21,400. Whereas,  the large farmers are having farming experience of 29 years, with no more than 3 people involved, with  average investment per acre Rs. 24,200, which is significantly higher than that of marginal, small and  medium farmers (Figure 5.12). It indicates that the large farmers are taking advantage of new technology  mostly tractor drawn farm implements like improved plough, cultivator, seed cum fertilizer drill and'},\n",

The KCC scheme was introduced to ensure that the credit requirements for farmers in the agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sector are met. This was done by helping them avail short-term loans and provide them with a credit limit to purchase equipment and for their other expenses as well. Moreover, with the help of KCC, farmers are exempted from the high interest rates of the regular loans offered by banks as the interest rate for KCC starts as low as 2 per cent and averages at 4 per cent. Under this scheme, farmers can repay their loans depending on the harvesting period of their crop for which the loan was given.some other welfare schemes primarily targeted to weaker sections are old-aged, widowed are Aasara pension schemes. It is a welfare scheme of pensions to old people, widows, Goud community, elephantiasis patients, AIDS afflicted people, physically disabled and beedi workers. Each person is getting Rs.1,000 per month, now it is revised to Rs.2,000 per month, All these schemes are important and having significant popularity among the villagers.

Lavanya ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar, Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State Majority of the Indian farmers are small and marginal and lack of necessary capital to invest in agriculture (Reddy, 2012; Kumar, 2013; Ramprasad, 2019). Hence, availability of credit at low interest rates are crucial for adoption of various inputs and also to meet daily consumption needs. The availability of credit determines input use pattern, technology adoption, investments in land development, cost of cultivation and farm incomes (Cole, 2009; Reddy et al.,2020; Reddy et al.,2021). In general farmers first preference is formal sources like commercial banks, Regional Rural banks (RRBs), cooperatives, then from the semi-formal institutions like Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and last preference is informal sources like friends and family, traders, input dealers and moneylenders as they charge higher interest rates. Since years, farmers have been taking credit from different sources as they are unable to get optimum income from the agricultural activities. The credit behavior of the households by village, social group and land class are discussed in this chapter. Figure 16.1 presents the per cent of household’s accessed credit during the study year. 98 Figure 16.4: Outstanding credit of the household’s by village Figure 16.5: Source and amount of credit of the household’s by social group Figure 16.6: Outstanding credit of the household’s by land class category 117 J.

Crop, 2. 96 Figure 16.2: Sources of finance in the study villages Figure 16.2, indicates sources of credit and the main source of credit in the villages are RRBs (55.2 per cent of the household’s accessed credit) followed by SHGs (43.3 per cent) and friends and relatives (26.8 per cent). Access from commercial banks, cooperatives, moneylenders, input dealers and traders are very less. Overall, the findings indicate that farmers are accessing credit from low interest charging sources like RRBs, SHGs and friends and relatives compared to higher interest charging sources like moneylenders (Figure 16.2 and 16.3). Figure 16.3: Number of sources of credit taken by household’s by village, social group and land class Taking credit from multiple sources is increasing, because they may not be getting the required amount from single source. Although only 86 per cent of household’s have access to credit some are having access to credit from 2-3 sources. Figure 16.3 presents number of sources from which farmers accessed credit. Overall, 43 per cent accessed credit from single source, while 36 per cent accessed from 2 sources and 7 per cent accessed from 3 sources. About 14 per cent ST household’s, 10 per cent of small and 11 per cent of medium size landholding category farmers accessed credit from three sources.52 per cent of landless, 44 per cent medium and 42 per cent small landholding farmers accessed credit from two sources. Overall, the data indicate that taking loans from multiple sources are problem for small and About 86 per cent of household’s have taken credit atleast from any one source. Share of households who accessed credit is low in Mallampet (79 per cent of household’s) and highest in Nagampet (90 per cent), access to credit is higher among OBC household’s (91 per cent), while less among ST household’s (72 per cent) and among SC household’s it was 86 per cent. Access to credit was lower at 73 per cent among landless and marginal farmers (84 per cent) than small farmers (93 per cent). Overall, the Figures indicated that SC/ ST household’s and landless labour had less access to credit compared to other household’s.
