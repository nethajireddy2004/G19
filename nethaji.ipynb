The SCs are sometimes  referred to as Dalit. The Scheduled Castes comprise about 16.6 per cent of India’s population (according  to the 2011 census). The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 lists 1,108 castes across 28 states  in its First Schedule. For much of the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent, they were known  as the “Depressed Classes”. Since the independence of India, the SCs were given Reservation status,  guaranteeing political representation. The Constitution lays down the general principles of positive  discrimination for SCs. The Constitution provides a three-pronged strategy to improve the situation of SCs: Protective arrangements: Such measures as are required to enforce equality, to provide punitive  measures for transgressions, and to eliminate established practices that perpetuate inequities.  Affirmative action: Provide positive treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education as a  means to accelerate the integration of the SCs with mainstream society.  Development: Provide resources and benefits to bridge the socioeconomic gap between the SCs and  other communities. Legislation to improve the socioeconomic situation of SCs because twenty-seven  per cent of SC households lived below the poverty line, compared to the mere eleven percent among  other households. Additionally, these castes were poorer than other groups in Indian society, and they  suffered from higher morbidity and mortality rates as per the National Commission for Scheduled  Castes. However, in spite of planned development and prioritization of scheduled caste households in various  development schemes, there are various reports, which pointed out that there is underutilization of  funds and intended benefits were not reached to the targeted households. To address the problem of  underutilization of the allocated budget for SC upliftment, the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SCSP)  program was initiated by the Government of India.  The SCSP mandated a planning process for the social, economic and educational development of SCs  and improvement in their working and living conditions. It was an umbrella strategy, ensuring the flow  of targeted financial and physical benefits from the general sector of development to the Scheduled  Castes. It entailed a targeted flow of funds and associated benefits from the annual plan of union  government in at least a proportion to the national SC population. Twenty-seven states and UTs with  sizable SC populations are implementing the plan. Objective of the Scheme The main objective of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) - Central Research  Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad component of the SCSP programme is to identify  major problems faced by the SC households in these three villages to come out of poverty and plan,  prioritize and implement household-oriented schemes for overall socio-economic development. ICAR- CRIDA will provide resources and technical support to fill the critical gaps and by providing vitaliv inputs to achieve the target of improved livelihoods, socio-economic development. Since the schemes/ programmes for SCs depends on the local occupational pattern, economic activities and resource  endowments, the implementing agencies have been given flexibility in utilizing the funds with the  only condition that it should be utilized in conjunction with SCSP and other resources available from  various line departments like agricultural and rural development departments, various corporations and  financial institution etc. National Institution for Transforming India\\xa0(NITI) Aayog guidance, ICAR notified Kotapally mandal  of Mancherial erstwhile while Adilabad for overall development of scheduled caste households in a  time bound manner with specific budget allocation. As in the Kotapally mandal share of SC population  in total population was higher at 25 per cent, while in the district their share is only 15 per cent and only  16.6 per cent in India as per the Census 2011. Upon receiving the approval, the study team of ICAR- CRIDA visited the mandal and identified three villages for developmental intervention for intensive  development of the SC households.  The CRIDA team adopted a unique approach called “Problem Driven Iterative Adoption” where  in the team has identified the problems faced by the SC households, diagnosed and dissected these  problems and evolved solution in partnership with the local stakeholders, mainly farmers. This baseline survey is a part of identifying the specific problems of the farmers and identify solutions  in partnership with the farmers. The specific approach followed under the PDIA is given below.

Osman and G. Ravindra Chary  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The concept of Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) was envisaged by the erstwhile Planning Commission  of India (now National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, New Delhi) at the time of  formulation of Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85) with the objective to ensure adequate benefits under  SCSP for socio-economic and educational development of Scheduled Castes (SCs) both in physical and  financial terms by providing funds, out of total allocation of the State Plan, at least in proportion to the  percentage of SC population in the state (Dushkin, 1967; Planning Commission, 2007; Pattenden, 2011;  Bhagavatheeswaran, et al., 2016; Acharya and Sahoo, 2019). The SCSP is designed to channelize the flow of benefits and outlays from the general sectors in the plan  of the states and central ministries for the development of scheduled castes in physical and financial  terms.  These plans are envisaged to help poor Scheduled Castes families through composite income generating  programmes during the Sixth Plan period (1980-85). Such family-oriented programmes are to cover  all the major occupational groups amongst scheduled castes such as agricultural labourers, small  and marginal farmers, share-croppers, fishermen, sweepers and scavengers and urban un-organized  labourers below the poverty line. Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJ & E) is providing 100 per cent grant under the  Central Sector Scheme of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) as  an additive to SCSP to the States/UTs to fill the critical gaps and vital missing inputs in family-oriented  income generating schemes with supporting infrastructure development so as to make the schemes  more effective. The objective of the SCA is to provide additional support to Below Poverty Line (BPL)  SC families to enhance their productivity and income. SCA could also be utilized for infrastructural  development in the blocks having 50 per cent or more of SC population. SCA is released to these States/ UTs on the basis of the following weightage criteria: (i)  SC Population of the States/UTs: 40 per cent  (ii)  Relative backwardness of the States/UTs: 10 per cent  (iii)  Percentage of SC families in the States/UTs covered by Composite economic development  programmes in the State Plan to enable them to cross the poverty line: 25 per cent  (iv)  Percentage of SCSP to the Annual Plan as compared to SC population percentage of the States/ UTs: 25 per cent2 SCSP implemented by ICAR-CRIDA One of the major problems identified for widespread poverty among SC households is low adoption of  modern technologies by the households and consequent low productivity and low household incomes.  Considering the potential of agriculture and livelihoods improvements among the SC households, Indian  Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is implementing SCSP in few selected districts of different  states. In each district a mandal or taluka has been identified which is having more than 40 per cent of  population of SC Communities. In Telangana state, Kotapally mandal of Mancherial district (erstwhile  Adilabad) has been identified for implementation of SC-Sub Plan by ICAR-CRIDA as in the mandal  share of SC population in total population was higher at 25 per cent, while their share was only 15 per  cent in the Mancherial district, 20 per cent in Telangana state and 16.6 per cent in India.  In this context, ICAR-CRIDA also received SCSP guidelines and funds for implementing SC-Sub Plan  and the Institute is implementing this in the identified Kotapally mandal. The plan was started in the last  quarter of 2018-19 and is being continued during the current financial year (2021-22). Three villages  having more than 40 per cent of SC population have been identified by ICAR-CRIDA in collaboration  with Department of Agriculture namely Mallampet, Nagampet and Edagatta for taking interventions  related to agriculture, horticulture, poultry and entrepreneurship and small business activities under  this plan. Later, the SCSP interventions by ICAR-CRIDA team were extended to the remaining 31  villages in the mandal. The names of the villages covered are Nakkalpalle, Brahmanpalle, Shankarpur,  Shetpalle, Pangadisomaram, Kotapalle, Vesonvai, Sarvaipet, Kondampet, Bopparam, Venchapalle,  Supak, Jangaon, Algaon, Pullagaon, Sirsa, Edula Bandam, Lingannapet, Pinnaram, Parpalle, Yerraipet,  Borampalle, Kawarkothapalle,  Annaram,  Arjungutta, Rajaram, Rampur, Kollur, Rawalpalle, Dewalwada  and Rapanpalle (Table 1.1).

The  goals may be increase in crop production, conservation of soil and water etc. Building local capabilities  for improving local communities’ capabilities needs constant support to formal (like Panchayat Raj  institutions) and informal (like farmers groups, women groups and youth groups) institutions and  individuals within and outside of government. Community based approaches and approaches which  build trust and relationships within community to take up activities like constriction of community  ponds is vital for sustainable development of villages. Under the SC-sub plan, one of the important  objectives of ICAR-CRIDA is to strengthen local capabilities to take up community wide development  programmes for the benefit of each and every one in the community.  The table 1.2 provides capability  matrix, which indicates the capability levels of different stakeholders in solving the prioritized problems.  In the table, green colour indicates the strong capability of individual/organization to solve the problems  in specific prioritized area, while red colour indicates weak capability, which needs to be improved  through training programmes and skill development.5 Table 1.2: Capability matrix: strengths and weakness matrix of stakeholders  Priority area  Individuals/organizations/institutions Credit  Individuals  Cooperatives  Commercial banks  Money lenders  Agricultural  technology  Farmers  ICAR- CRIDA Department of agriculture  KVK Kitchen garden  Households  ICAR- CRIDA Department of horticulture  KVK Nutrition  Households  Aanganwadis Integrated Child  Development Scheme  (ICDS) ICAR-CRIDA Soil health  Farmers  ICAR- CRIDA Department of agriculture  KVK Water  conservation   Farmers  ICAR- CRIDA District Rural  Development Agency  (DRDA) KVK Note: Red colour indicates weak capability, yellow indicates moderate; green indicates strong;  Source: Focus group interactions with key stakeholders References Acharya, S., & Sahoo, H.

Nirmala, K. Nagasree , A. Amarender Reddy and R. Nagarjuna Kumar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  A multipronged strategy was followed by involving a multidisciplinary team. Along with ICAR-CRIDA  Scientist’s, officials from line departments such as department of agriculture and rural development  were also involved in the implementation of the scheme. The basic strategy was illustrated in Figure 2.1.  Figure 2.1: Strategies/activities planned for improvement of SC farming community7 Entry Point Activities In order to gain confidence of all the stakeholders, especially among SC farming community, women  farmers, women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and youth, ICAR-CRIDA scientists and project team  organized a number of Village wise focus group discussions with each group separately and also in  larger group. The main objectives of these focus group interactions are: (i)  To understand the existing socio-economic condition of the villagers (ii)  To understand the availability and use of basic amenities and public facilities (iii)  To assess the livelihoods and cropping pattern of the farmers (iv)  To understand the problems faced by the farmers in farming and also in adopting various  livelihoods strategies (v)  To assess the technological adoption levels and problems in adoption by the farmers (vi)  To understand farm, off-farm and non-farm employment and incomes sources (vii)  To plan and prioritize development pathways  Gram Sabha’s and Focus Group Discussions In order to understand and identify major problems faced by the SC community, SCSP implementation  committee organized the Gram Sabha and constituted an advisory committee named “SC Sankshema  Samithi” in each selected village (Figure 2.2), in this committee there was adequate representation of  weaker section of the community within SC households like women farmers, disabled and women- headed households.  These Samithi members were active in all activities undertaken like soil and water management  measures, distribution of improved varieties of seed, horticultural planting material, procuring and  rearing improved breeds of livestock and poultry, starting of custom hiring centre and procurement of  farm implements and identification of farmers for training programs etc. Figure 2.2: Gram Sabha’s and FGD’S to understand the local problems,  prioritise and plan the activities8 The overall approach followed by ICAR-CRIDA in the implementation of the SC-Sub Plan in the  selected villages is adopted from Problem Driven Iterative Adoption (PDIA) as illustrated in Figure 2.3  (Andrews et al., 2013; Rao, 2014; Andrews et al., 2015). Figure 2.3: Adopted Problem Driven Iterative Adoption (PDIA) approach  for implementation of the SC-Sub Plan  Source: https://buildingstatecapability.com/tag/pdia-course/page/5/ PDIA emphasizes a problem-driven, iterative approach, which involve essential principles viz., (i)  identification of burning problems, solving defined problems through; (ii) creating an environment  amenable to experimentation; (iii) creating tight feedback loops and; (iv) engaging a broad set of actors.  The Figures 2.3 and 2.4 illustrates the various steps involved in the PDIA approach for development.  Past experience shows that successful development schemes have mostly followed PDIA principles,9 though these may not have been acknowledged explicitly. The PDIA approach is based on solving a  particular performance problem in a specific process. Here the problems are poverty, low agricultural  productivity and low farmer’s incomes.  Figure 2.4: Problem Driven Iterative Adoption cycle adopted to SCSP implementation  by ICAR-CRIDA Source: https://www.intdevalliance.scot/application/files/5715/0211/8537/MEL_Support_Package_4th_June.pdf Methodology of organising the baseline survey  Immediately after the identification of the intervention villages, the study team conducted baseline  survey. The baseline survey was carried out in year 2019 for the crop year 2018-19, before any type  of intervention. A detailed questionnaire was developed in consultation with all the different subject  matter experts to cover all aspects of the farmer’s basic-socio-economic and technological status before  the implementation of the SC-Sub plan programme in the villages. The questionnaire covered fourteen  sections covering (i) location details: farmer-household basic information; (ii) access to basic amenities  like bus stand, school, bank etc.; (iii) extent of use of public amenities and other government welfare  and development schemes like Soil Health Card, Rythu Bandhu (direct money transfer based on cropped  area); (iv) family details like age, education, occupation, income and employment; source of income and  employment pattern (like income from crops, livestock, agricultural labourer, non-farm employment,  migration and other sources); (v) landholding pattern like extent of owned land, leased-in land, leased- out land and total operational holding with extent of dryland and wet land; (vi) cropping pattern by  season and by irrigation status; (vii) general living standards like owning two wheeler/four wheeler,10 mobile, TV, refrigerator, electricity; (viii) type of farm machinery owned including desi plough, seed  drill, drip irrigation, sprayers, tractors etc., (ix) ownership of different livestock like bullocks, buffalo,  cows, goat and sheep; (x) credit behaviour of the farmers which include amount and source of credit  and interest rates both from formal and informal sources; (xi) insurance (awareness about insurance  scheme) especially the ongoing crop insurance scheme (Prime Minister Fasal Bhima Yojana), (xii)  benefits received from the different development and welfare schemes, (xiii) technology adoption in  major crops (like improved seed, fertilizer use, use of micro-nutrients, pesticide use, harvest and post- harvest practices), (xiv) technology adoption in livestock sector like owning good shed for livestock,  use of concentrated mixture, artificial insemination and vaccination. The questionnaire is attached in  Annexure 1. The questionnaire was pre-tested in the study villages and rectified for any corrections based on a set of  criteria developed by OECD (OECD, 2008) like (i) clear meaning; (ii) data is easily available; (iii) less  effort in data collection and does not require expert analysis; (iv) sufficiently representative for the total  of the intended results; (v) tangible and observable and; (vi) if difficult to quantify but very important  (in this case a proxy indicator was used to capture the approximate value of the intended variable). A total of ten data collection staff was recruited and trained for data collection. The data collection was  done in two month’s, later the data was complied, tabulated and analysed to draw the references and  conclusion. There part is prepared which was to be used as ready recknoer for planning intension during  the project period of September and October 2019.  References Andrews, M., Pritchett, L., & Woolcock, M.

Nagarjuna Kumar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The SC Sub Plan programme of Government of India is implemented across all the states by different  implementing agencies. As a part of it, ICAR-CRIDA implemented it in Mancherial district of Telangana  State as in the district SC population share is significantly higher and most of them are living in below  poverty line. In general, backward districts like Mancherial received very little public investment and  development expenditure since long in Telangana (Melkote et al., 2010 and Rao, 2014). In this chapter  general socio-economic and demographic and agricultural profile of the study area was illustrated.  I. Area Mancherial district is carved out of erstwhile Adilabad district of Telangana state. It is located in  northern Telangana bordering Maharashtra with highest share in forest area and scheduled tribe and  scheduled caste population. It is surrounded by Asifabad (Komaram Bheem), Adilabad, Nirmal, Jagityal,  Peddapalli, Bhoopalapally districts and the Maharashtra state (Figure 3.1). The district comprises of 18  mandals, two revenue divisions - Mancherial and Bellampalli and 382 villages. The district Headquarters  is located at Mancherial town. Figure 3.1: Telangana state map with Mancherial district Mancherial is well connected through its roadways and railways. Mancherial is one of the A category  railway stations of Secunderabad division and Bellampalli is also a major railway station in the district  (details of the district is given in Annexure 2). The state highway (SH1), national highway (NH63) and12 Nagpur highways run through the district, making the entire region well linked. It has one State Road  Transport Corporation (RTC) bus depot at Mancherial. Rivers Godavari and Pranahita pass through it.  Paddy is the major crop in the district, recently cotton area was increased. Housing a precious coal belt,  the district is home to Singareni Collieries and Jaipur Thermal Power Plant. It also possesses several  private cement manufacturers and ceramics factories. The ceramic pipe industry, which is the largest in  the in the country, is definitely an icing on the cake. Mancherial district boasts of the crocodile sanctuary  near Chennur and thick forest under a part of the Kawal Tiger Reserve. Gudemgutta Sri Satyanarayana  Swami Temple is a noted pilgrim centre in the district (Figure 3.2 and 3.3). Figure 3.2: Kotapally mandal headquarters with location of three study villages  identified for baseline survey demarcated Figure 3.3: Geographical location of villages identified for baseline survey,  with demarcation of nearest Chennur town13 II. Demography As per Census 2011, Mancherial district is having a population density of 201/sq. km, as against the  state average which is 312/sq. km. The total population of the district is 8,07,037 which accounts for 2.3  per cent of the total population of the State. The rural population accounts for 56 per cent. (4,53,151)  of the total population in the district. The total number of households is 2,06,983. So, the average  household size is 3.8. The sex ratio (females per 1,000 males) is 977. The total literacy rate is 64  per  cent in the district. The female literacy percentage is quite low (55.59 per cent) compared to the male  literacy rate (73 per cent) in the district. The share of workers in total population is 43 per cent. Total  scheduled caste population is just 15.5 per cent in the state, while their share was 25 per cent in the  district. Overall, the Mancherial district is little more urbanised than Telangana state, but having more  gender discrimination with lower sex ratio than the state, having more SC population and low density  of population (Figure 3.1).

District Agricultural Profile Climate Mancherial district falls under agroclimatic zone of Northern Telangana Zone. Normal annual rainfall of  this district is 1,065 mm, during South West Monsoon (rainy season spanning from June to September)  average rainfall is 953.20 mm, North East Monsoon (October to December) average 69.4 mm, during  winter season average rainfall is 7.60 mm and during hot period (summer) average rainfall is 28.9 mm.  Average annual temperature on average ranges between maximum 34.9 0C and minimum 22.0 0C with  mean hottest temperature 42.6 0C and the average relative humidity varies from 61-90 per cent. The  soils are of clayey to gravelly clayey, moderately deep dark brown soils, loamy to clayey skeletal deep  reddish-brown soils and shallow loamy to gravelly clay red soils. Many village tanks in the district are  renovated under Mission Kakatiya (tank renovation scheme of Telangana state), but still maintenance  is not proper (Figure 3.4).  Figure 3.4: Tank in Nagampet village (before renovation) in Mancherial district Agriculture Mancherial district is predominantly agrarian based. It has been a home for Gondi people who mainly  depend on agricultural activities for their livelihood. Later the district became industrialised by the  establishment of coal mines. But still the people engaged with agriculture (cultivation and agricultural  labour) make up to 56 per cent of total work population.  (Source: https://mancherial.telangana.gov.in/documents/). Landholding pattern in the district is similar to that of the Telangana state. A large number of populations  hold up to 1 ha of land and only 0.39 per cent of the population operates 10 ha and above landholding  (Table 3.2).15 Table 3.2: General characteristics of Telangana state and Mancherial district  S.No. Parameters Telangana state Mancherial district 1 Land holdings a) Marginal (up to 1 ha)  34,20,202 (62.0) 92,733 (63.8) b) Small (1-2 ha)  13,18,390 (23.9) 30,723 (21.1) c) Semi-medium (2-4 ha)  5,98,145 (10.8) 16,756 (11.5) d) Medium (4-10 ha)  1,65,127 (3.0) 4,654 (3.2) e) Large (10 ha and above)  15,647 (0.3) 581 (0.4) Total 55,17,511(100) 1,45,447 (100) 2 Cropped area (ha.) a) Gross cropped Area (GCA) 48,93,148 95,568 b) Net cropped Area (NCA) 41,74,532 84,931 c) Gross irrigated Area (GIA) 20,27,663 30,698 d) Net irrigated Area (NIA) 14,86,241 30,698 e) Cropping intensity (GCA/NCA)*100 117 113 f) Irrigation intensity (GIA/NIA)*100 136 100 3 Area under different crops (ha.) a) Rice  14,71,710 25,831 b) Jowar 83,401 1,021 c) Maize 7,12,981 3,553 d) Red gram 2,51,121 2,262 e) Green gram 95,524 1,775 f) Black gram 31,221 110 g) Bengal gram 80,766 388 h) Groundnut 1,77,914 293 i) Sunflower 17,574 324 j) Chillies 82,649 721 k) Sugarcane 34,775 0 l) Cotton 16,77,492 50,200 m) Horticulture 6,64,326 23,513 4 Agriculture marketing (Nos.) a) Agriculture market committees 180 5 b) Rythu bazars 5 Livestock population a) Cattle 48,80,293 2,11,945 b) Buffaloes 41,60,419 96,960 c) Sheep  1,28,35,761 2,96,133 d) Goats 45,75,695 1,45,376 e) Others 6,20,723 4,859 Total 2,70,72,891 7,55,27316 S.No. Parameters Telangana state Mancherial district 6 Poultry population 8,07,50,833 4,95,788 7 Veterinary facilities a) Poly clinics  8 0 b) Hospitals  100 2 c) Dispensaries  907 27 d) Mobile clinics  37 1 e) Rural livestock units  1,102 15 8 Fisheries a) Fish rearing tanks/reservoirs  24,294 707 Water spread area (ha.) 8,00,269 13,980 b) Fishermen Coop.

The Net Cropped Area (NCA) represents the total area sown with crops and orchards. Area sown  more than once in the same year is counted only once. The NCA is 84,931 ha in the district, while  Gross Cropped Area was 95,568 ha. The GCA represents the total area sown once or more than once  in a particular year, i.e. the area is counted as many times as there are sowings in a year. This total  area is also known as total cropped area or total area sown. The Net Irrigated Area (NIA) is the area  irrigated through any source once in a year for a particular crop is 30,698 ha. It means only 36 per cent  of NCA is irrigated in the district. The gross irrigated area which is the total area under crops, irrigated  once or more than once in a particular year is same as that of NIA in the Mancherial district. Cotton  covers the large area in both state and the district followed by rice and horticulture crops. Maize, red  gram and green gram are grown by a significant farmer, but on smaller parcel of lands. There is a good  scope for crop diversification and intensification by expanding irrigated area in the district as both  cropping intensity and irrigation intensity are low. There are 180 agriculture market committees in the  state with 5 of them in the Mancherial district. Although there are 36 Rythu Bazars (direct farmer to  consumer markets) in the state, but don’t exist in the district. Relatively cattle and goat population in  the district is higher compared to sheep, buffalo and poultry as farmers still use cattle for ploughing and  other agricultural activities and also dairy and goat for meat purpose. Veterinary facilities consist of 2  hospital, 1 mobile clinic and 27 dispensaries in the district. Water spread area in the state accounts for  8,00,269 ha with only 1.7 per cent of that water area spread in the Mancherial district. The district is  mostly dependent on 707 fish rearing tanks/reservoirs for fishing and also for irrigation.17 Kotapally Mandal Kotapally mandal comes under Chennur division of Mancherial district. The distance from mandal  headquarters to district headquarters is 52 km. The mandal consists of 37 revenue villages. A revenue  village is a small administrative region in India, a village with defined borders. One revenue village  may contain many hamlets. Each revenue village is headed by a Village Administrative Officer. The  mandal comprises 34 Gram Panchayats (Gram Panchayat is a basic village-governing institute in Indian  villages. It is a democratic structure at the grass-roots level in India. It is a political institute, acting as  cabinet of the village. The Gram Sabha works as the general body of the Gram Panchayat. Out of 39,428  ha total geographical area, 47.2 per cent is forest area, only 27.1 per cent is cultivable land, but about  25.4 per cent is cultivated. About 70.1 per cent of cultivated area is under rainfed. Cropping intensity  is 116, which indicates that only 16 per cent cultivated area was sown twice (Table 3.3 & Figure 3.5 &  3.6).  Table 3.3: Basic information of Kotapally mandal Basic information about Kotapally mandal  Land use pattern in the mandal  •  Mandal: Kotapally •  Division: Chennur •  District: Mancherial •  Distance from Mancherial: 52 Km •  Number of revenue villages: 37 •  Number of deserted villages: 2 •  Number of gram panchayats: 31 •  Average rainfall: 1,160 mm •  Total geographical area: 39,428 ha •  Area under forest cover: 18,624 ha •  Total cultivable land: 10,671 ha •  Gross sown area: 10,032 ha •  Area under cultivation in rabi: 1,602 ha •  Area under cultivation in kharif: 10,034 ha •  Area under rainfed condition: 7,101 ha •  Area under irrigated condition: 2,931 ha Figure 3.5: Location map of SCSP villages in Kotapally mandal,  Mancherial district, Telangana state Kotapally18 Figure 3.6: Normal cropping pattern in hectares (Kharif and Rabi) in Kotapally mandal Figure 3.7: Detailed cropping pattern in Kotapally mandal The cropping pattern in Kotapally mandal is dominated by cotton and paddy in kharif season and  paddy in rabi season. There is a need for crop diversification and expansion of irrigated area, so that  the cropped area under pulses and millets can be increased with one or two critical irrigations. (Figure  3.7). The similar domination of cotton and paddy was observed in all three study villages (Table 3.4). As  seen from Table 3.4, cotton cropped area is predominant in all villages followed by area under paddy.

Although CRIDA team initially selected three villages namely Mallampet, Nagampet and  Edagatta from the Kotapally mandal of Mancherial district in Telangana state for interventions under  SCSP plan, later on activities were extended to cover all the remaining 31 villages of the mandal such as  Nakkalpalle, Brahmanpalle, Shankarpur, Shetpalle, Pangadisomaram, Kotapally, Vesonvai, Sarvaipet,  Kondampet, Bopparam, Venchapalle, Supak, Jangaon, Algaon, Pullagaon, Sirsa, Edula Bandam,  Lingannapet, Pinnaram, Parpalle, Yerraipet, Borampalle, Kawarkothapalle, Annaram, Arjungutta,  Rajaram, Rampur, Kollur, Rawalpalle, Dewalwada and Rapanpalle. Three villages namely Chintakunta,  Ayepalle and Adkapalle are with no habitation of population are not covered under the ICAR-CRIDA  SCSP activities. Although, SCSP activities covered 34 villages of the Kotapally mandal, the baseline  survey was carried out in only three selected villages to economize on the cost of conducting the survey  with proper sampling framework, so that the survey represent all the villages in the mandal. A team  of ICAR-CRIDA along with local administration visited all the villages and reviewed the secondary  administrative information available with district officials, three villages namely Mallampet, Nagampet  and Edagatta are selected for baseline survey as they represent all the agro-ecological and socio- economic conditions of the mandal and also having moderate number of households, it means they are  neither too big or too small and represent an average village situation not only in the mandal, but also  in the state and as well as the country. The numbers of households are maximum in Mallampet (254),  followed by Nagampet (241) and the least in Edagatta (131), which are moderate in size and represents  an average village in India. Basic socio-economic profiles of the villages are given in Table 4.1. The  study team followed standard census procedure while collecting data from all the selected three villages  as it covered all the households in the villages (Pedigo and Buntin, 1993; Singh and Masuku, 2014) Among the three villages, Mallampet is the largest village with 1,002 population followed by Nagampet  (966) and Edagatta (512). The total households in Mallampet are 254, Nagampet are 241 and Edagatta  are 131. Sex ratio was highest in Mallampet (1,028), followed by Edagatta (969) and least in Nagampet  (876). Overall and female literacy rate was lowest in Mallampet compared to other two villages. STs  population was less than 5 per cent in all three villages, but SCs population was above 50 per cent in  all three villages with the highest in Nagampet (58.5 per cent) and Mallampet (56.7 per cent). Working  population was highest in Mallampet (57.5 per cent) and lowest in Edagatta (45.1 per cent). Overall,  the data indicates that Mallampet was educationally backward followed by Nagampet and Edagatta.  While, SC and ST population was highest in Nagampet, followed by Mallampet and Edagatta. In all  parameters, Edagatta was more developed compared to other two villages.20 Table 4.1: Demographic profile of the selected villages Parameter Mallampet Nagampet Edagatta Total population 1,002 966 512 Total number of houses 254 241 131 Sex ratio 1,028 876 969 Total literacy rate (%) 45.5 % (456) 58.0 % (560) 56.6 % (290) Female literacy rate (%) 17.4 % (174) 23.3 % (225) 23.8 % (122) Scheduled tribes population (%) 2.6 % (26) 4.7 % (45) 0.2 % (1) Scheduled caste population (%) 56.7 % (568) 58.5 % (565) 49.8 % (255) Working population (%) 57.5 % 56.1 % 45.1 % Child (0-6) population, 2011 111 61 51 Sex ratio (among 0-6 years  population), 2011 820 488 1125 The baseline survey was carried out by following census method. That is each and every household was  surveyed by using pre-tested questionnaire. The questionnaire was canvassed a total of 504 households  for the study. From Mallampet village 156 households, from Nagampet village 243 households and from  Edagatta 105 households (Figure 4.1). The total household members in the villages are different from  census 2011, as many households are migrated out especially from Mallampet. All the data collected  was post-classified based on social groups, land holding groups and area groups (village). Figure 4.1: Sampling details of selected villages References Pedigo, L.

Rejani ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The SC-Sub plan programme is implemented in three adopted villages of Kotapally mandal of  Mancherial district in Telangana state viz., Edagatta, Mallampet and Nagampet from year 2018-19.  This chapter illustrates the socio-economic profile of the households in base line year 2018-19. The  socioeconomic profile of the villages is assessed by the following methods: 1.  Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools  2.  Focus Group Discussions (FGD) 3.  Primary Survey. 1. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA): Recently renamed as Participatory Learning for Action  (PLA), is a methodological approach that is used to enable farmers to analyse their own situation and to  develop a common perspective on natural resource management and agriculture at village level. PRA is  an assessment and learning process that empowers farmers to create the information base they need for  participatory planning and action. Outsiders contribute facilitation skills and external information and  opinions. Many different tools have been developed for use in PRA. There are four main classes: tools  used in group and team dynamics; tools for sampling; options for interviews and dialogue; and options  for visualization and preparing diagrams. It is a way of learning from and with community members  to investigate, analyze and evaluate constraints and opportunities, need assessment and priorities in  the field of agriculture and other social and economic development programmes addressed to village  developed. In PRA, seasonal analysis to assess the seasonal trends relating to farming and allied fields and problem  identification tools has been used in the present study.  a) Seasonal analysis: This is one of the PRA tools that indicates the specific activities that occur during  the different months relating to farming and allied fields. It helps to know about labour requirement,  migration, disease and pest incidence, natural calamities that occur and other important relevant events  affecting farming activities. South West monsoon (June to September) is the major source of rain for kharif crops in the study  villages (Figure 5.1). In the month of May, land preparation activity takes place. In June, sowing of  paddy seedlings in nursery along with sowing of cotton commences. In July, the various activities  scheduled are paddy transplanting; fertilizer application to cotton; Foot and Mouth disease, Hemorrhagic  Septicemia and Black quarter disease incidence in cattle. In August, weeding and pest appearance like  stem borer in paddy; pesticide and fertilizer application in cotton at 15 day’s time interval twice. In  September, pesticide and fertilizer application in cotton at 15  day’s time interval take place twice. In  October, paddy harvesting and cotton picking commences and there will be high demand for labour. The  peak demand for labour is from June to November, after November, up to May there is no much demand22 for labour except public works like The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,  2005 (MGNREGA). Most of the men are engaged in ploughing, land preparation, spraying of pesticides,  while women are engaged in transplanting of paddy, weeding in both paddy and cotton and picking of  cotton. Sowing operations are done by both male and female.  Activity Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May. Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec.

Accordingly, ten key informants among farmers in each village were  selected for recording their responses. The maximum number of key informants pointing to a particular  problem was identified as number one ranked problem; the second maximum number of  key informants  pointing to a problem as second ranked problem etc., was the procedure followed in ranking problems.  The problems are listed below: i.  Low incomes and yields ii.  Water scarcity iii.  Lack of knowledge on intercrops, crop rotation iv.  Low productivity of horticultural crops v.  Low productivity of kitchen garden  vi.  Low awareness on soil and water conservation activities vii.  Pest problems in maize viii.  Lack of mechanization in crops ix.  Unstable market prices x.  Problem of wild boar xi.  Low awareness on alternate sources of women employment The problem of low yields and incomes is analysed and decomposed in to causes and sub-causes as  shown in Figure 5.2.23 Figure 5.2: Fishbone diagram of problem diagnosis 2. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted to elicit qualitative data from farmers.  Focus Group Discussions were organized among farmers, agricultural labourer, women groups, youth  to identify problems and solutions in a participatory approach. The main problems identified are   (i) Low crop yields; (ii) Low income; (iii) Youth unemployment; (iv) Market price fluctuation;   (v) Lack of tarpaulins for drying grains between harvest and marketing; (vi) Lack of appropriate farm  machinery for pumpsets, sprayers, improved cultivators; (vii) Lack of skills to engage in alternative  income sources like livestock rearing and off-farm and non-farm activities; (viii) Improved varieties of  crops and livestock breeds, etc. (Figure 5.3).  Figure 5.3: Farmer’s problems and average score (1-10:10 highest) 3. Primary survey was conducted through interview method to elicit quantitative data from farmers  with the help of questionnaire.24 A) Social groups (Caste) The percentage distribution of household samples based on the socio-economic status is illustrated in  Chart 1-4. It can be observed from the collected 504 samples that there is a prominence of Scheduled  Caste (SC) households’ (74 per cent) which is followed by Other Backward Caste (OBC) (20 per cent)  and Scheduled Tribe (ST) (6 per cent) (Figure 5.4 & Table 5.1). A majority of the households in each  village are from the scheduled caste followed by backward caste and then the scheduled tribes. There  is no household belongs to Forward Caste (FC/OC), except Mallampet where only one household is  there. Predominance of SC households in these villages are also associated with low level of access to  public infrastructure like roads, schools and hospitals due to historical neglect in investments in public  infrastructure. Table 5.1: Distribution of household’s by socio-economic groups Village SC ST OBC FC/OC  Total Edagatta 65 11 29 105 Mallampet 135 6 14 1 156 Nagampet 174 12 57 243 Total 374 29 100 1 504 Figure 5.4: Percentage distribution of household’s by caste group under each village25 B) Land holdings Historically, land is the only source of income generation in these types of remote villages due to lack of  alternative sources of income. Size distribution of land holdings is one of the most important indicators  of measuring the income opportunities and economic power structure and interrelations between and  among the households, type of technological adoption, profitability and employment within the villages.  Distribution of households in the three villages based on landholding size class is depicted in the Table  5.2. It provides a distinct picture of the high proportion of marginal landholdings (more than 50 per  cent with less than 1 ha) akin to the traits of Indian agriculture landholding size. Marginal and small  farmers (1-2 ha) together are contributing to about 80 per cent of farmers of sample households in all  the three villages. Less than 2 per cent of the landholdings are large size holders with more than 10 ha  in the sample. Table 5.2: Distribution of household’s by land holding class by village Village Marginal Small Medium Large Total Edagatta 63 (60.0 %) 30 (28.6 %) 11 (10.5 %) 1 (1.0 %) 105 (100 %) Mallampet 77 (49.4 %) 48 (30.8 %) 28 (17.9 %) 3 (1.9 %) 156 (100 %) Nagampet 116 (47.7 %) 78 (32.1 %) 46 (18.9 %) 3 (1.2 %) 243 (100 %) Total 256 (50.8 %) 156 (31.0 %) 85 (16.9 %) 7 (1.4 %) 504 (100 %) The land size classification of sample households among the socioeconomic groups is illustrated in  Table 5.3. Noticeably across all the socioeconomic groups the marginal lands stand out in percentage  terms over the small, medium and large size land holdings in all the sample villages. The share of  marginal landholders was 49 per cent among SCs, 83 per cent among STs, 47 per cent among OBCs and  nil among OC (Other/Forward caste) households. The share of large landholders among SCs is one per  cent, while among STs 10 per cent and among OBCs two per cent. It shows that among SCs, majority  of households belong to small and marginal farmers category, with only one per cent belonging to large  farmers category, while among STs and OBCs share of large farmers are little better.  Table 5.3: Distribution of household’s by land holding class by social group by village Village SC ST OBC FC/OC Marginal Small Medium Large Total Marginal Small Medium Total Marginal Small Medium Large Total  Medium Total  Edagatta 62 28 11 0 100 91 9 0 100 45 38 14 3 100 0 0 Mallampet 47 33 17 2 100 100 0 0 100 50 21 29 0 100 100 100 Nagampet 47 32 20 1 100 67 8 25 100 47 37 14 2 100 0 0 Total 49 32 17 1 100 83 7 10 100 47 35 16 2 100 100 10026 C) Farm size of the household’s The average farm size of the households by social group is shown in Figure 5.5. In all the three villages,  the average farm size is less than 3 acre; however, farm size was slightly higher among STs followed by  SCs and OBCs. While for FCs it was 8 acres, but only one household belongs to this caste. Average farm  size was less than 3 acres in all three villages, but there is slight variation, Nagampet and Mallampet  average farm size was 2.9 acres, while it was only 2.4 acres in Edagatta. In terms of size of the land  holdings (Figure 5.6), all the three villages have nearly similar number of marginal, small, medium and  large farms. Marginal farmers with average farm size of less than one acre constitute 50 per cent of the  farmers, the average size of small farmers is just 3 acres, and their share in the sample farmers is about  30 per cent. Medium farmers constitute about 15 per cent with average farm size of 6.3 acres. While  large farmers share is just 5 per cent but the average size of the farms is 11.3 acres. The small farm size,  in addition to the low level of adoption of new technologies and no alternative sources of income are the  main constraints to come out of poverty for most of the households in the study villages.  Figure 5.5: Average farm size (in acre) by social group and village Figure 5.6: Average farm size (in acre) by land size category by village27 D) Household composition and education Educational level and literacy rates enhance the human power in households in multifaceted ways.  It generally increases employment and income opportunities within and outside the village, help in  adoption of new agricultural technology, getting benefits from different government schemes and  also help in overall participation of households in various socio-economic programmes in the village.  Average household size (number of family members in the family) getting reduced over the years, with  joint families replaced by nuclear families and also with the adoption of family planning. The average  household size of the study area is 2.8 which is much lower than the district average (3.8) and state  average (4). On average, male population is higher than female population in the villages, which may  be true, but sometimes may be due to under reporting of number of women due to the existing local  socio-economic conditions. However, in Edagatta, female population was higher than male population,  might be due to the outmigration of males to work in nearby towns and urban centres. The higher level  of outmigration in the village may be attributed to nearness to the road network which connected to  Chennur and farther to district headquarters Mancherial and Hyderabad. The average years of schooling  is around 6 years pointing towards the very low level of education among the people. The literacy status  of the head of the household is one of important attribute which capture the household’s socio-economic  status and also ability of the household to adopt new technology. The average literacy rate of the head  of the household was 27.2 per cent in the study area which is much lower than the district average of  75.7 per cent. The literacy rate was the highest in Edagatta (43.8 per cent) and lowest in Nagampet  (17.3 per cent). The higher level of literacy in Edagatta is also may be one of the reasons for higher  migration levels in the village (Table 5.3). The lower literacy rate in the study area may be attributed to  higher share of SC and ST in the villages and also remoteness of the villages. There is a vast difference  in literacy rate among land size classes and social groups. People with large landholding have highest  average years of schooling as well as highest percentage of literate heads in the households among all  the other landholding class. It is also to be noted that, large farmers are having bigger family size and  also with higher female population compared to other land size classes. The higher female population  among large land size class may indicate less discrimination against women mainly due to their higher  educational levels and higher literacy rates. Average family size among the SCs and STs are 2.8 and 2.6,  which indicates dominance of the nuclear families in the village coupled with out-migration of many  family members either due to education or for employment purpose (Table 5.4 & 5.5). During the focus  group interactions, many households reported that the aged parents are willing to live separately from  their children’s families to avoid conflicts among the members and also because of income received  from old-age pensions. There is no much difference among SCs, STs and OBCs in terms of education,  but only FC families are far better in both average years of schooling and also literacy rate of the head  of the family.

Across the sample villages the average family size is 3  out of which about 2 family members are involved in farming on an average and the same trend is also  observed across all the socioeconomic groups except for FCs where family size and family members  involved in the farming are same (Table 5.6 & Figure 5.7). The data indicates that, irrespective of  their age, all the household’s members are more or less engaged in agricultural activities, unless and  otherwise they are very old and not able to work. Even those old-aged people also participating in  some economic activities within their household premises, like involved in backyard poultry, work in  backyard gardening by growing vegetable crops, cleaning of grain and drying of grain, etc. (Figure 5.8,  5.9, 5.11).

The past experience shows that about 5-6 years of  farming experience is sufficient for almost all agricultural operations in more efficient way, more  experience also indicates that perpetuation in old agricultural practices, not inclined for change to new  and improved methods of agriculture. Most of the sample households have been involved in agriculture  for about 19 years (Figure 5.10), which indicates experience is not a constraint for adopting good  agricultural practices. On the other hand, a farmer with more than 15 years of experience habitual to do  only old agricultural practices, motivating him to adopt new and improved agricultural practices require  more efforts from the extension agencies and scientists. SC farmers on an average have about 20 years  of experience, while lowest is among STs with only 14 years of experience. Although farmers are still  using old type of ploughs, bullock carts, sickles (single-handed agricultural tool designed with variously  curved blades and typically used for harvesting) etc., they are also adopting new technology especially  fertilizers, pesticides, crop varieties (especially cotton), if they found useful and simple to use.  Most of the farmers own only drylands with minimal investments in agriculture. The average investment  per household was just Rs. 21,218/acre (Figure 5.10). Investment by SC households is little less than  all other households. However, there is no significant difference across the social groups in terms of  investment per acre. There is significant difference in investment per acre and also years of experience  in farming across land size class. The marginal farms are being tilled for 18 years with an average  investment of Rs. 20,800 with at least one family member of the sample households and a minimum of  two persons are engaged on small and medium farms with an average investment of Rs. 21,400. Whereas,  the large farmers are having farming experience of 29 years, with no more than 3 people involved, with  average investment per acre Rs. 24,200, which is significantly higher than that of marginal, small and  medium farmers (Figure 5.12). It indicates that the large farmers are taking advantage of new technology  mostly tractor drawn farm implements like improved plough, cultivator, seed cum fertilizer drill and31 harrow etc., and investing a significant amount to overcome the shortage of labour and increased wage  rates. Further, paddy crop operations like sowing, transplanting, weeding and harvesting are seasonal,  most of the operations are fully mechanized on large farms, but on marginal and small farms, still  farmers are doing most of the operations through manual labour, mostly by own-labour or many time  exchange of labour among neighboring farmers. The local wage rates are steeply increased after the  implementation of The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA:  100 day’s guaranteed public work for each household at minimum wage rates) especially for women.  Although, large farmers mechanized most of the paddy operations, still they are depending upon wage  labour for cotton cultivation mainly for weeding and picking. Especially during the paddy transplanting,  weeding and cotton weeding and picking there was huge demand for women wage labour and farmers  have to give money intime and also provide other amenities like arranging food, transport etc., during  the peak demand for labour. Male labourer are mostly engaged in land preparation, ploughing, inter- cultivation through bullocks, transport of grain, operation of tractor drawn implements like cultivators,  operation of sprayers and dusters, etc.  Figure 5.11: Women taking care of small ruminants Figure 5.12: Average number of family members involved in farming and  investment (Rs.) and number of years in farming by land class32 F) Investment capabilities of the households The average investment in agriculture on acre basis, Figure 5.13, is observed to be made highest by  the Scheduled Tribe farmers in the Edagatta village (Rs. 30,000) and the lowest by the FC farmers  in Mallampet village (Rs. 15,000). In total sample only one FC household is there, that too, they are  actively engaged in non-farm activities. This is half of what a Scheduled tribe farmer of Edagatta  village farmer pays. This shows that, slowly, farmers who have capabilities in terms of social contacts,  education are slowly investing out of agriculture and trying to settling down in non-agricultural activities  either they are petty business or engaged as contractors in construction or any other works related to  nearby town. Further, the average agriculture investment is higher in Edagatta village (Rs. 29,000) than  the Mallampet (Rs. 19,600) and Nagampet (Rs. 18,800) villages distinguishably. In Nagampet village  the average investment difference over the socioeconomic groups is seen to be little. One of the main  contributing factor of higher investments in Edagatta is it is well-connected through road networks  and easily accessible with all urban amenities. Although, there was significant difference among three  villages in terms of investment per acre, that difference don’t exists within the village among different  land size class farmers (Figure 5.14). That is both the large and marginal farmers in Edagatta invested  Rs 30,000 and 29,000, respectively, while large and marginal farmers in Nagampet invested Rs. 22,000  and 18,000 per acre, respectively. The average investment in agriculture for large farms is Rs. 24,000,  while among marginal, small and medium farms it is Rs. 21,000. Figure 5.13: Average investment in agriculture per acre by social group (Rs. 1,000/acre) Figure 5.14: Average investment in agriculture per acre by land class (Rs. 1,000/ acre)33 The above data illustrates that the farmers in these villages are not only deprived of less operational  holdings but are also economically backward and are unable to invest enough in agriculture and land  development to reap higher returns (as seen from the past studies of Gupta, 2005; Reddy et al., 2014A;  Reddy et al., 2014; Pattnaik et al., 2018; Jha et al., 2018). The condition is worst in Nagampet village and  in micro level, the FC farmers marginal farmers population are suffering badly, although for different  reasons. Being remote is working against Nagampet farmers as they are not well-connected to nearest  town and their other sources of income are low, hence they are not able to invest as that of Edagatta,  which is closely linked with nearest town. Except, large farmers all other category farmers are having  too small land parcels for cultivation, which is not producing enough returns to invest to improve crop  yields. Their incomes are hardly sufficient for their consumption needs.  However, the recent government Direct Money Transfer Schemes such as PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi is an initiative by the government of India in which all farmers will get up to   Rs. 6,000 per year as minimum income support) and Rythu Bandhu (Rythu Bandhu scheme also Farmer’s  Investment Support Scheme is a welfare program to support farmer’s investment for two crops a year  by the Government of Telangana. The government is providing Rs. 58.33 lakh farmers Rs. 5,000 per  acre per season to support the farm investment, twice a year, for rabi and kharif seasons) are playing an  important role to increase investments in farming by the farmers. Although crop insurance scheme is  implemented in the villages, very few are benefited.  References Gupta, D. (2005). Whither the Indian village?: Culture and agriculture in ‘rural’India.

Amarender Reddy and D. S. Ramanjul Reddy ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  In this chapter, household’s employment and income status, sources of income along with the ownership  of household durable consumer goods, assets across socio-economic groups and land size class are  discussed. Historically, the villages predominantly habituated by the SC households are generally poor.  The employment and income opportunities are not diversified, they mostly depend on agriculture,  especially in villages where droughts are recurring phenomenon and agriculture is rainfed (Reddy and  Kumar, 2006; Reddy, 2015; Blakeslee, 2020; ). The ownership of various household items (durable  consumer goods) like having TV, refrigerator, car/bike, etc., will give clear indication of the living  standards of the households, which can be comparable both temporally and geographically (Dreze and  Srinivasan, 1997; Saccani et al., 2017; Mahapatro et al., 2017). Many households also have permanent  assets in terms of agricultural land and household dwellings and some have gold jewellery and bank  savings accounts or LIC premium certificates.  A) Source of income The major source of income in all the three villages for the sample households is agriculture (61.1 per  cent), which is followed by wages from Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,  (MGNREGA) (16.8 per cent), off-farm income (5.0 per cent) and non-farm income (4.5 per cent).  The livestock contributes to only 3 per cent of total income (Figure 6.1). Other income is 8.4 per cent,  which might have included government supported direct money transfer schemes like schemes like old- age pension, Rythu Bandhu, PM-KISAN, etc. It is noted that migration is also an option for marginal  and small land holders, but there is no migration evident among the large farmers from the sample  households. Figure 6.1: Sources of income of households by land size class35 Among marginal farmers, because of the low agricultural employment and income, especially during  the post-rainy and summer season, MGNREGA became a considerable source of income, contributing  about 22.7 per cent of total income. Whereas, for large farmers its share is just 6.2 per cent of their  total earning, while they earn a major chunk (about 86 per cent) from agriculture. Livestock rearing is  more prevalent in medium size farmers with 5 per cent of their income, while its contribution is almost  negligible among large farmers. Income and employment diversification among marginal farmers are  higher especially towards public works under MGNRGA, off-farm and non-farm activities. Income  diversification is also picking up even among small and medium farmer’s (Table 6.1 and Figure 6.2).  Table 6.1: Household income per annum from all sources by farm size category Land size  class Percentage of total annual income  Average  household  income (Rs.) Crops Livestock Off farm  employment Non-farm  employment Migration MGNREGA Others Marginal 48.3 2.9 6.5 5.3 1.6 22.7 12.7 36,773  (100) Small 65.1 1.8 4.6 4.8 0.2 16.7 6.8 55,946  (100) Medium 68.5 5 5.8 3.5 0 11.3 5.9 87,624  (100) Large 86.8 0 4.1 2.1 0 6.2 0.8 1,72,857  (100) Total 61.1 3 5.6 4.5 0.6 16.8 8.4 53,174  (100) Figure 6.2: Sheep rearing in the village36 Average income of STs was the lowest, followed by OBC, SC and highest among FCs (Figure 6.3).  However, income gap among social groups is less than the gap between marginal and large land-class. It  indicates that, the social group as an indicator of economic status is losing relevance, while landholding  size playing a major role in higher incomes.  Figure 6.3: Sources of income by social group Among all social groups, ST households received the lowest share of income from agriculture (49.8 per  cent of total income), which was followed by SCs (60.4 per cent of total income) as against the 71.4 per  cent for FC households. Also, income from the livestock rearing is higher in the other caste group at 7.1  per cent and is the lowest for scheduled tribe at 2.8 per cent. Although agriculture is main source of income (71 per cent) for only FC/OC household present in the  sample, a good chunk of income is also coming from non-farm employment, which is highest among the  all the groups (21.4 per cent of total income). While non-farm incomes not crossed even 5 per cent for  all other social groups with lowest for the backward class at 2.8 per cent and for scheduled castes at 4.8  per cent. The large chunk from non-farm income for FC household, may be due to their higher level of  education and also assets and capabilities to start and build non-farm income sources like petty business  or engagement in contracts, etc. Whereas, the SCs, STs and OBCs lack those networks, capabilities like  initial human and physical capital to take advantage of non-farm employment. Almost 20 per cent of  the earnings of STs and SCs are received from MGNREGA. Off farm income is significant among STs  (off-farm income encompasses all agriculture-related activities that occur beyond the farm. Examples  of off-farm income and enterprise include processing, packaging, storage, transportation distribution,  and retail sale). Apart from STs and SCs, MGNREGA contributes to the income of OBCs significantly  at 14.3 per cent. However, involvement of FCs in MGNREGA activities is limited (Table 6.2). Table 6.2: Household income per annum from all sources by social group Social  group  Percentage of total annual income Average  household  income (Rs.) Crops Livestock Off farm  employment Non-farm  employment Migration MGNREGA Others SC 60.4 3 5.3 4.8 0.6 17.4 8.6 54,746 ST 49.8 2.8 19.3 5.2 0.8 19.3 2.8 42,931 BC 66.9 3 3.5 2.8 0.7 14.3 8.9 50,095 FC/OC 71.4 7.1 0 21.4 0 0 0 70,000 Total 61.1 3 5.6 4.5 0.6 16.8 8.4 53,17437 Table 6.3 illustrates the percentage of income through different sources for the sample villages. After  agriculture as the main source of income is public works under MGNREGA in all the three villages. In  Edagatta village, 32.2 per cent of income of the residents and 15 per cent in Mallampet and Nagampet  is through MGNREGA. Among all the villages, Edagatta is having very low average income per  household, whereas Mallampet and Nagampet are little better off. The main reason for low incomes in  Edagatta village is low-income diversification; there is almost no income from livestock, off-farm and  non-farm employment and also migration. Majority of the households in the village are just depending  on crop production, in the off-season like summer and post-rainy seasons they are engaged in public  works of MGNREGA. Although, average income of households in Mallampet village was highest, the  share coming from agriculture is only 53.2 per cent. There is significant income from off-farm and  non-farm employment (Figure 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and Table 6.3). Hence, in Mallampet, there is a need for  increasing agricultural incomes along with livestock incomes. In Nagampet income sources are more  diversified than other two villages.  Figure 6.4: Average income by villages Table 6.3: Household income per annum from all sources by village Village  Percentage of total annual income Average  household  income (Rs.)

Typically 25 per cent of the households in Edagatta, Mallampet and Nagampet villages are having either  car/bike (mostly two wheelers) and the smart mobile phone is less popular among the population as it is  used by only 40 per cent of the households. Despite 95 per cent or more households having electricity  facility, only 10.7 per cent of the households have a refrigerator whereas television is being viewed by  exceedingly over half the households of the three villages and a maximum in Mallampet at 74 per cent.  About 70 per cent of the households have ordinary phones, in which most of the communication is  from WhatsApp group messages, video stream relating to agricultural technology cannot be accessible.  Overall, there is no significant difference between the villages in ownership of household durables, still  a slightly lower use in Edagatta and more use in Mallampet and Nagampet were observed.  Figure 6.6: Traditional multipurpose shelter for livestock39 Figure 6.7: General living standards of households  (Percentage of households having different amenities) by village Figure 6.8: General living standards of households  (Percentage of households having different amenities) by socio-economic groups From the Figure 6.8, it is clear that accessibility to electricity reached more than 90 per cent in all social  groups, but still 10 per cent of STs 7 per cent of OBCs and 3 per cent of SCs are not yet accessing the  electricity, which is a basic necessity in modern life. In most of the goods, TV, smart phone, two-wheeler  and also in case of refrigerator ST households are worse off than even SC households. In the sample  villages, only one household belongs to FC and they have access to all the modern household durable  items. All though, accessibility to electricity and ordinary mobile phone are more or less uniform across  social group and also land class (Figure 6.8 and 6.9), there is significant difference in accessing the  TV, smart mobile, two-wheeler and refrigerator, this difference is much higher among land class group  (between large and marginal farmers), then between social groups (between ST and FC households).  Noticing through the land holding class and social group, with the existing adequate electricity facilities,  refrigerator is not a popular durable good when compared to news/entertainment/communication goods  such as television/mobile phone.40 Figure 6.9: General living standards of households  (Percentage of households having different amenities) by land size class Figure 6.10: Mode of transport into the village Figure 6.11: Participatory Rural Appraisal in the study village41 Overall, the income levels (the annual income of Rs. 53,174 translating in to monthly income of Rs.  4,431) are very low in the study villages compared to the income levels (Rs.10,218 per month) of the  recent nationally representative sample from the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) almost  of the same period of 2018-19. The low incomes compounded with low level of social networks being  dominated by SC and ST households reduce their capabilities to earn higher income. Even though most  of the households having access to electricity, they don’t have other modern amenities like TV/smart  phone, which indicates their lower living standards which needs to be increased through enhancing  incomes from not only agriculture but also from livestock, off-farm and non-farm activities (Figure  6.10 and 6.11).

Meghana  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The provision of public goods by the government is one of the best strategies of poverty alleviation  (Chhibber et al., 2004; Benerjee and Somanathan, 2007; Roy 2021).The access to basic amenities  like electricity, gas connection for cooking, sanitation, potable water for drinking, ration shop to get  subsidized food under Public Distribution System (PDS), school, nearest bus stand for accessing  public transport, market for selling the agricultural produce and purchase of inputs and other necessary  household items, Primary Health Centre (hospital) to consult doctor and bank for financial services  like saving etc., are indicators of getting access to public goods and also indicates efficiency of local  government in provision of public goods to the citizens (Reddy et al., 2016; Ansary and Da, 2018 ).  This chapter examined the access to public amenities and also public goods by the households in the  SC-Sub plan villages.  A) Access to basic and essential amenities The basic amenities such as drinking water, electricity, sanitation, housing, drainage and others are very  crucial for a secure, dignified and healthy human life. The existing status and access to such amenities  reflects standard of living, and poverty levels, especially in\\xa0rural\\xa0areas. In all the villages, access to  electricity and cooking gas connection is almost saturated, except a few gaps, like still 7 per cent  households in Mallampet don’t have access to electricity, while about 10 per cent don’t have access to  gas connection. Access to sanitation and tap water is uneven among the villages, mostly not reached  to the poorest of the poor like disabled, old-aged and households with no earning member. Among the  three villages, Nagampet village is badly placed in terms of basic both sanitation and potable water. In Edagatta village, more than 90 per cent of the households have access to all the amenities mainly  its proximity to Kotapally mandal headquarters, whereas, about 40 per cent households in Mallampet  village do not have access to potable water. In Nagampet village, only 36 per cent households have  access to potable water and about 54 per cent have sanitation facility (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Percentage of households having essential amenities by village43 Figure 7.2: Percentage of households having essential amenities by social group But among the social groups, except forward caste households, access to sanitation and potable water is  poor, it is especially serious in case of potable water. Among, SC, ST and BC households, ST households  are slightly better placed with regard to potable water as the community firmly represented their issues  through their elected representatives and secured government funded potable pipeline connections  under Mission Bhagiratha (Figure 7.2). Figure 7.3: Percentage of households having essential amenities by land size class Again, irrespective of the land-holding size, access to potable water is a major problem. Even among  large farmers who are in general better access to all these amenities, only 86 per cent having sanitation  facilities in their house, the remaining 14 per cent households not having access to sanitation, which  needs to be bridged (Figure 7.3) and access among marginal farmers is just 69 per cent. One positive  aspect is, across social as well as landholding groups, electricity and gas connection amenities are  available to almost all the households. So, overall it is clear that the study area is deprived of the  most important essential amenities like tap water and also sanitation which are an indication of overall44 backwardness, this is in spite of running of special programmes like Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)/ Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) for sanitation improvement and also state government programmes  like Mission Bhagiratha, which aimed at providing drinking water to each household in the villages  (Dandabathula et al., 2019; Srinivasan and Joy, 2019). During the focus group discussions, villagers  mentioned that the work is under progress and will be completed within one or two years mostly funded  by the government. B) Access to other public amenities Access and nearness to public amenities like ration shop, school, bus stand, market, hospital and bank  make life easy for rural dwellers saves time for daily commuting to avail facilities for these daily  essentials (Figure 7.4). Ration shop and school are within 1-2 km from their house for all the sample  households in three villages. Bus stand also less than 2 km, except in Edagatta village. While, distance  to market, hospital and bank is higher at about 3-6 km from home. (Figure 7.5 to 7.7). Mallampet village  has all the service facilities within 3.5 km, whereas, for Edagatta and Nagampet villages the Hospital  and Bank are far-off (more than 5 km away from the village). Figure 7.4: Nearest public school Figure 7.5: Average distance to access the amenities (km) by village45 Figure 7.6: Average distance to access the amenities (km) from house by social group Figure 7.7: Average distance to access the amenities (km) by land size class Figure 7.6 and 7.7 shows that bus stand, school, and ration shop are within 2 km of reach for all social  groups as well as the land holding groups. But the hospital, market and bank are distantly placed and  people need to travel to access these facilities. But it is apparently noted that the households of FC  community have a very easy access to all the facilities as these are quite nearer to them in comparison  to the other social groups. This scenario also corresponds to the better access in terms of nearness to  basic amenities for large farmers compared to marginal, small and medium farmers. But disparities in  accessing and nearness to basic amenities are larger among social groups than on the basis of land class  size. C) Access of various government schemes The villagers are mostly poor when compared to urban areas not only in the study area, but also across  India. The governments (central, state and local governments) have planned and running various  development schemes since independence with varied success rates. In line with this, there are various  ongoing government schemes in the study area among which Bank account (JanDhan: Pradhan Mantri  Jan Dhan Yojana is a financial inclusion programme of the Government of India open to Indian citizens,  that aims to expand affordable access to financial services such as bank accounts, remittances, credit,46 insurance and pensions) (Figure 7.8), ration card (ration cards offer identification as well entitle the  holder to a ration of food, fuel, or other goods issued by the Government of India), MGNREGA card  (The Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act 2005), is an Indian labour law and social security  measure that aims to guarantee the ‘right to work’. This act was passed in 23 August 2005, which  guarantees 100 days of employment in their own locality on demand), Aarogyasri card (Aarogyasri  Scheme is a unique Community Health Insurance Scheme being implemented in State. The scheme  provides financial protection to families living below poverty line upto Rs. 2 lakhs in a year for the  treatment of serious ailments requiring hospitalization and surgery), membership in SHG (A SHG is  a community-based group with 10-25 members. Members are usually women from similar social and  economic backgrounds; all voluntarily coming together to save small sums of money, on a regular basis  and use saved money for productive purpose like dairy. Rythu Bandhu scheme is also helping farmers  to meet their cash expenses in agriculture like purchase of seed and fertilizers. Under the scheme,  Telangana government is directly transferring cash to Rs. 58.33 lakh farmer’s bank accounts at the  rate of Rs. 5,000 per acre per season for both rabi and kharif seasons at the beginning of crop season.  Another important schemes is the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, which is a Government of India  scheme which provides farmers with timely access to credit. The KCC scheme was launched in year  1998 with the aim of providing short-term formal credit to farmers and was created by NABARD  (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development). The KCC scheme was introduced to ensure  that the credit requirements for farmers in the agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sector are  met. This was done by helping them avail short-term loans and provide them with a credit limit to  purchase equipment and for their other expenses as well. Moreover, with the help of KCC, farmers are  exempted from the high interest rates of the regular loans offered by banks as the interest rate for KCC  starts as low as 2 per cent and averages at 4 per cent. Under this scheme, farmers can repay their loans  depending on the harvesting period of their crop for which the loan was given. some other welfare  schemes primarily targeted to weaker sections are old-aged, widowed are Aasara pension schemes. It  is a welfare scheme of pensions to old people, widows, Goud community, elephantiasis patients, AIDS  afflicted people, physically disabled and beedi workers. Each person is getting Rs.1,000 per month, now  it is revised to Rs. 2,000 per month, All these schemes are important and having significant popularity  among the villagers. There are two aspects to the actual benefits received from the schemes. One is  having eligibility and essential eligibility card and another is whether the households are really getting  the benefits by using the eligibility. Figure 7.8: Nearest Bank (Regional Rural bank)47 Figure 7.9: Percentage of households having different eligibility cards and  use of different government schemes Figure 7.9 presents scheme wise beneficiary households in the sample villages. Overall, many  households are actually benefited from bank account under Jan Dhan Yojana, ration card, MGNREGA  works, Rythu Bandhu. While, benefits from getting Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) from government  departments, aarogyasri, Aasara pensions are less. However, popularity of Aarogyasri and SHGs are on  par with more popular schemes like ration card and MGNREGA.  Figure 7.10: Scheme wise beneficiaries by social group Figure 7.10 and 7.11 depicts benefits and uses for households from various government scheme by  social group and land holding class. The Figures shows that irrespective of the social group and land  holding groups over 90 per cent of the sample households possess ration cards and bank accounts.  However, utilization of these are little bit less. Also, there is a good coverage of MGNREGA card and  Aarogyasri cards; however utilization of former is more than the later. Aasara pensions are also popular  among the old-aged, but still some are not able to get due to lack of proper age certificate or residence  certificate. And it is very surprising to see that most of the people except large land holders and FC48 households are unable to get the access to the information from various departments through SMS,  which is very important to create awareness and intimating the households about various developmental  information. The government officials are recently using WhatsApp messages for sending messages,  that too not all households, as officials are having contact numbers of only progressive farmers.  Overall, there is almost universal access to some public amenities like electricity, ration card, MGNREGA  works, and bank accounts, however, they are not all using and getting benefits from them. Although  many farmers have SHC cards and Aarogyasri cards, their utilization is less. While the SMS sent to  citizens regarding government schemes are less and their utilization for decision making is still lower,  hence there is a need for increasing awareness of importance of SMS in dissemination of information.

Srinivas, Ashish Dhimate and Shailesh Borkar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Use of farm machinery and equipment play a greater role in agricultural incomes. Farm equipment and  machinery play a vital role in enhancing agricultural productivity and improving income. Therefore, lack  of access to agricultural equipment can be a limiting factor for the agricultural development of the farm  households. Use of appropriate farm machinery will save time and increase labour productivity and also  reduces drudgery. This will allow men and women to have more time for doing other ancillary works  (Ball et al., 1997; Rada and Fugie, 2019). In India farm mechanization picked up steeply since last two  decades in all activities like land preparation, inter-cultivation, weeding, harvesting and threshing. But  the adoption levels are uneven with higher mechanization in some crops like wheat, chickpea, cotton,  etc. (Singh, 2005; Mehta et al., 2019 ). In study villages, still modern farm machinery and farm implements are not popular. They are mostly  using desi plough (iron/wood) for land preparation, bullock cart for transport, manual sprayers and  dusters and blade hoe for weeding, etc. A significant number of farmers are using tractors for land  preparation mainly on hired basis. About 10 per cent of the households are having power sprayers. Less  than 2 per cent of the households have sprinkler set or drip irrigation, pumpset, fertilizer cum seed drill,  modern plough, BBF planter, blade harrow, chaff cutter, etc. The below Figure indicate that, in terms  of farm machinery the villages are backward (Figure 8.1). Our focus group discussions indicate that,  there is a need for pumpsets, power sprayers and dusters, modern ploughs, sprinklers and dusters with  the increased acreage under cotton.  Figure 8.1: Percentage of farmers using different types of farm machinery50 Use of farm machinery and equipment in three villages and among varied classes of social groups  and land size groups in the sample villages are presented in Tables 8.1 to 8.3 and Figures 8.2 to 8.4  respectively. Among the three villages, farm mechanization is more or less same, but little more in  Edagatta compared to other two villages. In Edagatta, tractorization and use of power sprayers and  sprinkler sets was higher, where as in Nagampet and Mallampet many are still using bullock carts and  desi plough.

In general, farm  mechanization and ownership of different modern farm implements increased from marginal farmers to  large farmers. Except the large farmers, there is a negligible use of power tiller and tractor. However, the  bullock cart is being used not only by many of the marginal farmers but also most of the small, medium  and large farmers. Even though with the change in times, ownership of tractors increased, the use of  bullock carts is not decreased in the villages, may be due to the ready availability of draft animals in  the village.

Edagatta  village farmers are adopting more modern farm machinery due to their nearness to town and more  accessibility and exposure to outer world. Still majority are using desi plough, bullock cart, and manual  sprayers. Among modern farm machinery, tractor is more popular across all social groups and also land  categories, as hiring of tractor is scale neutral.

Srinivas ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State Historically, soils play very important role in formation of human civilization and still paying a major  role in agricultural dependent economies. The dynamics of agricultural growth, employment and long  run sustainability depends on soil fertility and management. Soil fertility is one of the important factors  that determines the productivity and profitability of crops, cropping and farming systems. In simple  terms soil fertility is the ability of the soil to provide all essential nutrients required for plant growth in a  proper proportion. In order to achieve higher productivity and profitability, every farmer should realize  that fertility levels must be measured as these measurements can then be used to manage soil fertility in  terms of choosing appropriate cropping pattern and fertilizer use. As a part of baseline survey, a team of  scientists from ICAR-CRIDA collected soil samples and analysed them in ICAR-CRIDA soil test lab  and based on the results recommended the appropriate crops and crop rotations and also recommended  appropriate fertilizers and micro-nutrients for higher yields and profitability.  Currently the tools available for measuring the fertility levels of the fields are: a) Indigenous knowledge;  b) Plant/Tissue analysis; c) Visual diagnosis; d) Remote sensing; e) Soil testing/analysis; f) Greenhouse  pot experiments and; g) Biological tests, of all these tools, soil analysis is widely used for measuring  the fertility status of the soils as this technique is simple, rapid, cost-effective, accurate, universal, and  works for all kinds of soils.  Soil testing and its importance: Soil analysis is generally defined as any chemical, physical and  biological measurement that is made on the soil. Whereas, soil testing represents a programme that  includes soil sample collection, method of analysis, interpretation of results, evaluations, fertilizer and  amendment recommendations based on soil analysis and on several other considerations (Reddy, 2019;  Purakayastha et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2019). The objective of soil testing are to: a) accurately determine  the available nutrient status of soils; b) clearly indicate to the farmer the seriousness of any deficiency or  excess that may exist in terms of the various crops; d) express the results in such way that they permit an  economic evaluation of the suggested fertilizer recommendations and; e) to identify the type and degree  of soil-related constraints like acidity, salinity and alkalinity and to recommend the amount of lime or  gypsum to be added for reclaiming acid and sodic soils, respectively.  A sound soil-testing programme requires an enormous amount of  background research. This background  research should determine, the significant chemical forms of the available nutrients in the soils of the  area, the extractants most suitable for extracting all or part of the available nutrient forms, the relative  productive capacity of the soils of various crops, the differential response of the various rates and  methods of fertilizer applications for different crops, field sampling techniques, test procedures and  methodologies. The soundness of the required interpretive judgments will depend on the thoroughness  and quality of these background studies and it is aptly said that the success of soil testing is directly  proportional to its research backing.55 Soil fertility assessment in Kotapally mandal  Assessment of soil health and its management can help in enhancing the profitability of the resource- poor farmers of rainfed areas. Hence, efforts were made to assess the initial soil fertility status and also  to identify the soil related constraints affecting the crop production in Kotapally mandal of Mancherial  district, Telangana state under SCSP programme.  For assessing the soil fertility status 100 random soil samples from the farmer’s fields of three villages  viz., Mallampet, Nagampet and Eddagatta of Kotapally mandal were collected during March 2020.  The collected soil samples after air-drying were analyzed for major and micro-nutrients by following  standard methods. The results of the analysis of the soil samples are presented below: a) Organic carbon status: Analysis of the soil samples for organic carbon status revealed (Table 9.1)  that about 83 per cent of the soil samples in Mallampet are classified as low or deficient in available  nitrogen, whereas, in Nagampet and Edagatta about 64 and 55 per cent of the soils, respectively are  deficient in available nitrogen. It could also be seen that only 17 per cent of the samples in Mallampet  are classified either as medium or high in organic carbon status. Overall, about 70  per cent of the  samples in Kotapally mandal are classified as low in organic carbon status indicating that the soils of  the mandal are deficient in available nitrogen.

Overall, about 45 per cent of the soils of three villages are  deficient in available phosphorus and about 55 per cent of the soils tested medium to high for available  phosphorus.

Only about 7 per cent of the soil samples in the three villages were low in  available potassium.  Table 9.3: Village wise available potassium status Village Number/ percentage of  soil samples testing under different category  for available potassium  Low Medium High All Mallampet  2 (5) 16 (39) 23 (56) 41 (100) Nagampet  3 (8) 14 (36) 22 (56) 39 (100) Edagatta 2 (10) 7 (35) 9 (45) 20 (100) Overall 7 (7) 37 (37) 54 (54) 100 (100) Note: Figures in the parentheses indicate per cent of samples  c) Available DTPA extractable micro-nutrients: The results of the soil analysis with respect to DTPA  extractable micro-nutrients such as iron, copper and manganese revealed that the soils of the three  villages can supply adequate quantities of these micro-nutrients (Table 9.4). However, with respect to  available zinc more than 90 per cent of the samples were deficient in available zinc.  Table 9.4: Village wise available zinc status Village Number of soil samples testing Deficient Adequate All Mallampet  34 (83) 7 (17) 41 (100) Nagampet  39 (100) 0 (0) 39 (100) Edagatta 17 (85) 3 (15) 20 (100) Overall 90 (90) 10 (10) 100 (100) Note: Figures in the parentheses indicate per cent of samples  Conclusion In general, Indian soils are deficient in soil organic carbon status, in line with the national soil conditions,  soils in the villages are low in soil carbon (70 per cent), and only 7 per cent of soil tests are indicated  high status. On the other hand, soil available phosphorus is moderate in general with only 45 per cent  of the samples with low status, 34 per cent medium and 21 per cent high status. When compared to  available phosphorus, available potassium was high in the soils, with 54 per cent reported high, 37 per  cent reported medium and only 7 per cent reported low. But the disturbing issue is most of the soils  (90 per cent) are deficient in micro-nutrient like zinc. Overall, based on the results, the farmers have to  focus on potassium deficiency in soils in addition to severe deficiency of zinc and soil carbon.57 References Joshi, P.

Narsimlu  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Managing water is vital for not only agriculture, but also animal husbandry and also for human  livelihoods. Importance of water management is still more important in predominantly rainfed areas  (Reddy et al., Hope, 2007). Godavari zone of Telangana (Adilabad district) has been classified as  Agro Ecological Sub Regions (7.3) and is characterised by semiarid climate with farming situation of  vertisols/alfisols and 1,150 mm precipitation and the major cropping pattern of cotton followed by rice  during kharif season and rice fallows during rabi. Agriculture is the major source of livelihood of the  people in this region. However, agricultural productivity in the region is very poor due to lack of water  resources during the terminal drought situation in spite of good annual average rainfall. Therefore,  the habitats of the region are one of the poorest farmers in India and mostly belongs scheduled caste  families. In view of this, the present study initiated with the following objectives.  In the study area, rainy season duration is four months from June to September with average rainfall  of 1,100 mm; this rain water needs to be stored used for crop production in the remaining months.  Hence, water conservation and harvesting and reusing are crucial for overall development of rainfed  areas. Kotapally mandal in the Mancherial district has Integrated Watershed Management Program  implemented by District Rural Development Authority (DRDA), Govt. of Telangana with the assistance  of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Govt. of India. The watershed consists of  several villages with focus on treatment of soil and water conservation measures.  The basic infrastructure developed in the watershed for water resource development were percolation  tanks in the farm of earthen dams constructed for rainwater harvesting in the farmer’s fields (Kerr, 2002;  Datta, 2015). Water harvesting structures like Percolation tanks and dug out ponds both as community  structures and on individual land holdings is a key intervention in most land and water conservation  program. Two types of soil, alfisols and vertisols are more prominent in dryland regions. The vertisols  having high clay content and higher water retention capacity causes low permeability and thus has  higher runoff potential. Whereas, alfisols is light textured soils which have low moisture holding  capacity but high water intake and thus has low runoff potential. Many watershed programs in this  region, mostly emphasized to increase the water table in the vicinity through activity involving surface  water harvesting and utilization. The water harvesting mostly achieved in small percolation tanks and  farm ponds, the harvested rainwater was recycled as lifesaving irrigation/supplemental irrigation to  attain sufficient soil moisture for successful crop production.59 According to Mohanty et al., 2014, under on farm research study, the water harvesting structures  were constructed in farmers’ field on a participatory basis in which farmers contributed to a part of  the expenditure. Multiple use of water was done from the water harvesting ponds to develop them as  integrated farming system models along with imparting adequate trainings and exposure visit to the  farmers. The results indicated that there was substantial improvement in the livelihood of the rainfed  farmers due to the technological interventions. Water harvesting is an ancient tradition and has been  used for millennia in most dry lands of the world; many different techniques have been developed.  However, the same techniques sometimes have different names in different (Oweis 2004). The on- farm runoff collection into farm ponds and recycling through supplemental irrigation can increase and  stabilize the crop production. There is an abundant scope and opportunity for harvesting excess runoff  in the rainfed region in different states of the country (Wani, et al., 2003, Sharma et al, 2009). About 400 (Percolation tanks) structures were created for water storage and use for irrigation to paddy  down word side of the structures. Since, the runoff potential is high with annual average rainfall of the  watershed is about 1,100 mm. The soils are medium to deep vertisols in 90 per cent of the watershed and  the rest sandy loam where horticulture crops are grown particularly mango. The study area in Kotapally  mandal has been delineated in to Kondampet watershed with a drainage area of 5,886 ha covering the  villages and part of Nagampet, Kondampet, Mallampet, Edagatta, Sarvaipet, Pinnaram and Shetpally. The flow direction varies from Northwest to Southeast, the elevation difference varies from 124-190  MSL, and major land use is crop lands, followed by forest and drylands. The soils are mainly vertisols  with ISDA class of Vp20-3a-3866 and the major slope is gentle topography (0-2 per cent). The thematic  maps of watershed, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Land use/Land cover( LULC), soils and slope  were shown in Figure 10.1.

The shale, limestone and sandstone of Penganga formations overlie granites/gneisses and  occur in north of Adilabad and Asifabad area and between Mancherial and Asifabad town. The Sullavai  formation comprising grits, conglomerates and sandstone rest over Penganga formations in Mancherial,  Sipur-Kagaznagar area. The Gondwana formations consisting of sandstone, which occupies the eastern  part of the district in Sirpur, Asifabad, Mancherial, Chennur and Yemanpalle area. The Deccan traps  are represented by both vesicular and massive basalt and occupy the central and western part of the  district. Sub recent alluvium consisting of laterite occurs as capping over Deccan traps in Utnoor Taluk.  Recent alluvium consisting of sand, silt and clay occur along the river courses. The Granite, gneiss,  schist, limestone, dolerite and basalt rocks are grouped under consolidated formation. The Gondwana  formations comprising sandstones, shales, limestones, etc., form a thick sequence of sediments and are  grouped under Semi-consolidated formations. The Unconsolidated formations consist of laterites and  recent alluvium [Central Ground Water Board (CGWD) report 2012-13]. Occurrence and movement of ground water Climate, distribution and intensity of rainfall, topography, geological formations, aquifer matrix such as  weathering, joints, fractures, fissures, bedding planes, recharge conditions, transmissivity and storage  conditions of the aquifers, etc., play an important role in occurrence and movement of ground water.  Hydrogeological map along with area recommended for artificial recharge of the district is in Figure.  10.2. Figure 10.2: Hydrogeology map of erstwhile Adilabad district, Kotapally mandal  shown in black circle62 But, the geology of some parts of villages viz., Nagampet, Edagatta, Kondampet and Mallampet of  watershed area is with lime stone layer to a depth of 1 to 2 m. Lime stone underlying the black soil will  have very low recharge potential due to low seepage rate and were shown in Figure10.1. Because of  these reasons, the bore wells are not functional but there is a scope for shallow open wells. However, the  farmers draw the water from percolation tanks/earthen dams through pipe outlet of 4 to 6” (10 to 15 cm  dia) for irrigating the paddy fields. The initial capacity of these structures varied from 800 to 3,500 m3  and silted over the years thus reducing the capacity of the structures by 20 per cent to 5 per cent. There  are about 50 per cent SC farmers having these structures in Kotapally mandal in different villages. Based on the discussion with farmers in the above villages, farmers constructed percolation tanks in 0.5  acre area to 1.0 acre area and sparing even half of the land holdings for water harvesting. This practice  of water harvesting was found even from their ancestors. The existing PTs were not in proper shape,  leaving a big hump in middle and there were no provision of spillways/waste weirs for disposal of  surplus water and several time the bunds were breached due lack of these waste weirs. Keeping in view  of groundwater recharges restrictions due to limestone layers and improper construction of PTs. It was  decided to rejuvenate the existing PTs into on farm reservoirs (OFRs), 18 PTs have been selected from  18 farmers for renovation of their existing PTs. The first set of 18 SC farmers of Nagampet, Mallampet and Edagatta were selected for rejuvenation of  these structure for desliting as well as for enhanced capacity ranging from 2,300 to 5,600 m3 capacity so  that cropping intensity could be increased under these structures along with enhanced water productivity.  The total expenditure incurred from SCSP budget was Rs.32 lakhs for rejuvenation of these earthen  dams with enhanced capacity. The farmers were trained on the rainwater harvesting and utilization  through sprinklers with irrigation pipes which were already distributed to SC farmers in the area. The  rejuvenation program was implemented in convergence with DRDA through MoU with Commissioner,  PR & RD, Govt. of Telangana. The list of the farmers is given in Table 10.1 and the pictures of the  structure before rejuvenation are given in Figure 10.3 to 10.6.

With the climate change the frequency of these weather aberrations is increasing (Amadu  et al., 2020; Blakeslee et al., 2020). The three study villages are also predominantly rainfed areas with  large area under rainfed cultivation. These villages were treated under watershed schemes since two- three decades, but the constructed check dams, farm ponds are not properly maintained. Under SCSP  program, the ICAR-CRIDA team in collaboration with DRDA Mancherial, Telangana Government  are planning to renovate these farm ponds for not only recharging the ground water but also to provide  supplementary irrigation to save crops during the dry spells. There is also a scope for second crop by  utilizing the residual moisture, and a chance to go for relay cropping in the impounded area of On Farm  Reservoirs (OFRs).  References Amadu, F.

Lavanya ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The yield, cost of cultivation and technologies adopted are important determinants of sustainability and  profitability of the farmers (Reddy, 2014). Technology adoption and profitability depends on various  factors including local agro-ecology, resource endowments, awareness, landholding size and irrigation  (Palanisami et al., 2015; Pandey and Diwan, 2021). Keeping in view this chapter assessed the above  aspects village wise, social groups wise and land class wise. In the study villages only two crops cotton  and paddy are major crops occupying more than 90 per cent of the area. Hence, this chapter covers all  aspects of technologies, input use, prices received and profitability of these two crops.  Adoption of technology is not uniform in these two crops. Even for the same crop, some technologies  are already reached saturation level, while some other technologies are not even reached 20-30 per cent  of the farmers. For example, use of fertilizers and pesticide is almost saturated among both cotton and  paddy farmers, while use of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and micro-nutrients have not yet reached even  20 per cent in cotton, while their adoption is just about 30-35 per cent in case of paddy. Only 34 per cent  of the cotton farmers are irrigating their crop, while it was about 60 per cent in case of paddy (Table  11.1).

One cotton seed bag contains 450 gm  in case of hybrids and 3 kg in case of varieties, while paddy seed bag contains 10 kg. Generally, one bag is recommended per  one acre in both cotton and paddy case. 1 bag Urea contain 45 kg, 1 bag DAP and MoP/complex fertilizers contain 50 kg each.67 This chapter is divided in to two sections dealing separately with the technological adoption in cotton  and paddy separately.  1) Cotton A) Cropping pattern The largest commercial crop in the entire Mancherial district is cotton. The cotton crop cultivation  detailing is presented in Table 11.2 to 11.4. Cotton crop is being cultivated on an average of 695.5 acres  of the land in three villages collectively, of which 310 acres of Nagampet, 255 acres of Mallampet and  129 acres of Edagatta are included. About 30 per cent of cotton cultivated land area is under irrigation  with an average yield of 9.7 quintals per acre which was sold at Rs. 4,997 per quintal, which comes to  gross return of Rs. 48,471 per acre. Although, there is a significant difference in irrigated area among  three villages (with Edagatta highest and Nagampet the lowest), the average yield and average price of  the produce is almost similar across the three villages.

Consequently, average yield among SC farmers  is less than the other farmers. The SC farmers are getting less gross revenue (Rs. 46,972 per acre)  compared to ST farmers (Rs. 59,541 per acre) and OBC farmers (Rs. 52,322 per acre). Average area under cotton was 6.17 acre among large farmers, while only 1.04 acre among marginal  farmers. Percentage of rainfed area was higher among large farmers and consequently yields are less  among them and also gross returns also less (only Rs. 30,906 per acre) compared to medium farmers  (Rs. 51,428 per acre).  Figure 11.1: Group farming by village youth (cotton) A few youths in the village taken about 40 acres on lease and cultivating cotton by pooling land and  other resources. Figures 11.1 and 11.2 are showing the Figures of these pooled land cultivation.  Figure 11.2: Cotton crop cultivation by youth69 B) Technology The Tables 11.5 and 11.6 and Figure 11.3 shows the technology adoption for growing cotton crop by  villages, social groups and land holding classes, respectively. On an average farmer used 2.03 bags  of seed per acre, with slightly higher seed rate in Mallampet. Urea (Nitrogenous) fertilizer is mostly  used by the farmers and on average they used 3.17 bags per acre, while use of DAP is 2.53 bags and  MoP/Complex fertilizers is only 2 bags per acre. The use of FYM and micro-nutrients is less than the  recommended level and also only few farmers practice it. On an average farmers irrigated crop just  1.29 times, as most of them cultivated the crop as rainfed. All the farmers harvested their crop (cotton  picking) by manually engaging mostly women labour both family and hired labour. SC farmers used  higher seed rate, urea and DAP compared to other farmers. An examination of technology adoption by  land class size shows that, small and medium farmers used more fertilizer compared to both marginal  and large farmers, indicating inverted “U” shaped relationship between fertilizer use and farm size.  Overall, the data indicate that farmers are using more nitrogenous fertilizers than the recommended, but  use of micro-nutrients and FYM is less than the recommended. The use of irrigation water is also less  than the recommended due to predominance of rainfed area.

Paddy crop cultivation  characteristics by villages, social group and farm sizes category are presented in Tables 11.7 to 11.9.  Being the kharif crop Paddy is taken up on a total area of 647.9 acres in three sample villages. In the  study area paddy was grown as irrigated crop, but mostly as rainfed crop and also based on stored water  in the farm ponds and other water harvesting structures. The average yields vary from 14.3 quintal  in Nagampet to 21 quintals in Edagatta. It is important to note that though Nagampet village was  having maximum area under paddy cultivation, its yields are less in the village. The average price  realization was ranging from Rs. 1,695 to 1,752 per quintal. Most of the paddy production is procured  through government at Minimum Support Price (MSP), hence there is no much price variation among  the villages. The gross returns per acre ranged from Rs. 25,055 to Rs. 35,601, which are comparatively  less than cotton.  Table 11.7: Paddy crop details by village (Kharif) Village Cropped  area (acre) Average  area (acre) Percentage of  rainfed area Average yield   (Per acre) Average  price (per q) Gross returns  (Rs./acre) Edagatta 108.8 1.04 91.0 21.0 1,695.3 35,601 Mallampet 167.4 1.07 63.3 15.1 1,718.4 25,948 Nagampet 371.7 1.53 61.9 14.3 1,752.1 25,055 Total 647.9 1.29 67.2 15.9 1,731.6 27,53271 The average paddy area per farmer in the village was 1.29 acre. On an average SC farmers grow  paddy on 1.27 acre, while area is little less among STs (0.92 acre), but more among BC (1.41 acre)  and FC farmers (6 acre). More area was under rainfed among SC farmers than other social groups. On  an average yields are lower among SC and ST farmers than OBC and FC farmers. The gross returns  are higher among FC (Rs. 30,400/acre) and lowest among ST (Rs. 23,983/acre). These figures shows  nearly similar findings as that of the national picture as per the recent cost of production statistics of  Government of India (Table 11.8).

This is mainly due to its less labour requirement compared to cotton. It is also more  mechanized friendly crop except in transplanting and weeding operations. Per cent rainfed area was  less among small and medium farmers compared to marginal and large farmers. Average yields are  little higher among large and medium farmers compared to marginal and small farmers. Hence, overall,  gross returns are better among large and medium farmers than small and marginal farmers. Overall,  it indicates that large farmers are preferring paddy, while marginal and small farmers prefer cotton  cultivation.

The seed rate (1.81 bags/acre) is little higher than the recommended practice by the  research station, with no significant difference between villages. Similar to cotton, overall, farmers are  using more fertilizers than the recommended doses especially nitrogenous fertilizers. On an average the  use of Urea (2.86 bags/acre) is higher than the DAP (2.26 bags/acre) and MoP/Complex fertilizers (1.79  bags/acre). At the same time use of micro-nutrients and FYM was less than the recommended dose. On  average number of irrigations given are 2.25 times during the crop season, ranging from 1.32 times in  Nagampet and 4.8 times in Edagatta. About 60 per cent of the farmers harvested their crop by using  manual labour, while remaining 40 per cent using through machine. But slowly farmers are moving to  mechanical harvesting. One of the reason for using the manual harvesting is, it is more convenient for  harvesting paddy straw which can be used for animal fodder.  The results shows that the fertilizer consumption (Urea, DAP and MoP/Complex fertilizers) and  mechanization of harvesting operations were directly proportional to the farm size in case of paddy,  while there is no significant influence of difference in case of other technologies. The technology  adoption across social groups in paddy shows that, SC farmers use less MoP/Complex fertilizers, a  smaller number of irrigations and also less mechanized compared to other farmers. Mechanization  was much higher in paddy harvesting among OBC famers than both SC and ST farmers. Harvesting  methods vary across socio-economic and land size category of farmers (Figure 11.4) even now farmers  are using indigenous traditional storage structures to store the harvested grain (Figure 11.5).

Being very remote and under-developed areas, the  level of farm mechanization is still low in the study villages. However, the mechanization is much  higher among large farmers (70 per cent) due to their large landholdings and intention to harness scale  economies. Mechanization of harvesting operations is still very low among marginal farmers (only 14  per cent).  Figure 11.6: Technology adoption in paddy and cotton cultivation In general, farmers are using more fertilizers in cotton cultivation than paddy, mainly farmers have  more expectations on returns from cotton crop, although it is with more price and yield risk. Farmers  spray more pesticides in cotton than paddy. However, in case of paddy they gave more number of  irrigations (Figure 11.6).75 References Palanisami, K., Haileslassie, A., Kakumanu, K.

Prasad and Jagati Yadagiri  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Horticultural crops are the future engine of growth for increasing farmer’s income. The demand growth  rates from both domestic and international markets especially fruits and vegetables and also plantation  crops are increasing at the rate of 5-7 per cent per annum while the growth rates of food grains and  other crops are stagnant (Kumar and Mittal, 1998; Joshi et al., 2004; Chand et al., 2008). Recognizing  this, both state and central governments are promoting the horticultural crops, wherever possible by  providing various kind of incentives like subsidized plant material, maintenance subsidy until gestation  period is over, drip and sprinkler irrigation systems etc. (Paroda and Kumar, 2000; Sharma et al,  2018). Mango production in India is 4.3 million MT as per NHB-2017, Uttar Pradesh stands first as  mango producing state. This is followed by Telangana (2.73 million MT), Karnataka (1.75 million  MT) and Bihar (1.36 million MT) (NHB, 2017). Mango is one of the major horticultural crops having  good demand in Telangana. Mancherial is the one of the Telangana largest mango producing district.  During 2019-20 in Mancherial district the area of mango is 17,927 acres, production 75,293.4 MT’s  and productivity is 4.2 MT/ha\\xa0(Horticulture department Telangana) and it is very less when compared  to national productivity average 9.7 MT/ha. In Mancherial mango orchards were planted without any  pattern and recommended spacing and also pruning of the trees was not practiced. Overcrowding results  in the production of fewer fruits which are apt to be poorly colored and infected with diseases. Tall trees  also present a harvesting problem and create difficulties during spraying and pruning. Nearly most of  the farmers did not supplement their trees with any form of fertilizer but some use organic fertilizers  such as compost and manure. However, the rates of fertilizer required for mango trees are not met in  these areas. Mango trees are usually left unfertilized once established. Regarding insect pests and their  management, the major insect pests were red ant, leaf webbing red ant, hopper, fruit fly, thrips and  termites while diseases included powdery mildew and anthracnose. Anthracnose is common during wet  weather and powdery mildew is common during hot weather season. The study team of ICAR-CRIDA  plans to provide information and other support services for adoption of better management practices  in mango orchards in the study villages, so that the farmers income can be increased significantly in  Figure 12.1  Figure 12.1: Causes of low productivity of Mango77 Impact of changing climate on mango productivity Climatic change and unseasonal rain regularly dampen the prospects of mango farmers in southern  India. Late flowering and delayed fruit maturity and the resultant delay in harvest gets mango caught  in rains leading to very poor quality of mango. On the other hand with the prevailing severe cold, dew  and fog during the nights and increasing temperatures during the day, the mango flowering is subjected  to damage. However, throughout the country the rain and hailstorm accompanied by strong winds are  another climatic factor severely damaging the yields of mango crop. The mango hoppers and the powdery  mildew are affecting mango flowers to a large extent and it is now a regular trend. Under favorable  season if the mango harvest is delayed till pre-monsoon period then there will be severe damage due to  fruit fly and stone weevil. Apart from this, mealy bugs and tearstains are showing an increasing trend  leading to very poor quality fruits. An aberration in weather shows severe staggered flowering leading  to irregular maturity time of fruits. Severity of the problem is such that even paclobutrasol applications  have failed to induce flowering. Recurrent flowering from January-April diverts assimilates towards the  new panicles depriving the developing fruits. About 18 insects and 14 fungal and bacterial pathogens do  cause appreciable economic losses to mango in different growing regions. What we can do: Mango crop can be brought to good production by doing pruning, proper irrigation  methods, manures and fertilizer application, plant protection and intercultural operations like weeding.  Pruning Mango trees are generally pruned to remove dead or diseased wood to allow more light to penetrate into  the leaf canopy and to control the overall tree height. About 25-30 per cent of moderate pruning is done  on commercially grown mango orchards to reduce the canopy height and width of large trees. Ideally,  the tree will be shaped to have three and not more than four main trunks, have ample interior canopy  space and is 12-15 feet (3.5-4.5 m.) tall. Moderate, and even severe pruning, will not damage the tree,  but it will reduce production for one to several seasons, though is worth it in the long run. Spreading  branches are more fruitful than erect branches, so pruning seeks to remove them. Lower branches are  also pruned to four feet from ground level to ease the tasks of weed removal, fertilizer application and  watering. The basic idea is to maintain a modest height and improve flowering, thus fruit set. Mango  trees do not need pruning every year (figure 12.2) Figure 12.2: A schematic view of light penetration in mango tree78 Irrigation Mango needs to be watered throughout the first two years of their life to supplement rainfall and  encourage growth. Each tree needs about 26 gallons of water per week. Once established, watering  is done only during the flowering and fruiting periods, usually December to increase the number of  flowers and keep formed flowers from dropping. Controlling the amounts of water before and during  flowering will help maximize fruit yields. Water harvesting technologies for supplemental irrigation Mango in rainfed areas faces water shortage during critical stages. Harvesting of rain water holds promise  to provide the much needed water at critical growth stages of mango and/or crops grown on orchard  floors. Several examples of success of rainwater harvest under mango systems have been reported. In  Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh), farm pond water is used for supplemental irrigation in mango (Kumar et al.,  2016). Similarly, in a one hectare model 35 year old Alphonso mango based farming system developed  at ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru under NICRA has shown that it is possible to harvest water received during  early monsoon period for irrigating intercrops during mid monsoon dry periods. Further the water  harvested from the rains received during receding South West monsoon and further during cyclones  during North East monsoon benefit the crops during post monsoon period (Manjunath et al., 2018).  In hot semi-arid areas of Karnataka micro-catchments constructed in half-moon shape (semi-circular)  across mango trees capture surface runoff. Such constructions have resulted in yield enhancement by  over 22 per cent (Ali et al. 2017). In HDP (5m x 5m) of Arka Neelachal Kesri in Eastern India, cup-and- plate system of rainwater harvesting and mulching with paddy straw has resulted in maximum increase  in fruit yield. Such several ways of rainwater harvested in mango orchards are in place in several  regions (Figure 12.3).  Figure 12.3: Half-moon shaped micro-catchment Pitcher irrigation: It is probably the poor farmers drip irrigation, but less expensive to install. The  pitchers are the round earthen containers used in rural areas for water storage, ranging from 10 to  20 liters in capacity. This is a highly efficient traditional method in which unglazed porous earthen  pots containing water are buried under the soil to provide controlled irrigation to plants. Water slowly  moves out through the wall to meet the plant’s water requirement. In certain cases, pitcher irrigation  may outperform drip irrigation in Water Use Efficiency (WUE). This kind of irrigation is ideal for  establishing orchards for saplings, promoting deep root growth and to supply water at critical stages of79 crops during drought. Soluble fertilizers can also be mixed with water and applied through the pitcher  as fertigation. It can also permit sustained use of saline irrigation water. Drip irrigation and fertigation:\\xa0Irrigation\\xa0to\\xa0mango crop is still under controversial situation in India.  Generally, it is taken for granted that mango tree does not require an irrigation and can survive on  rainfall (700 to 800 mm during June to September). However, irrigation to mango orchards has shown  the beneficial effect that the tree bears fruits earlier i.e., 6 year onwards the number of fruits and fruit  size is increased. Similarly the effective fertigation programme of giving NPK nutrition becomes easier  through drip irrigation. Management of drip irrigation is of prime importance in mango orchards. In  drip irrigation, the drippers operate at a slow rate; usually the discharge matches the soil infiltration  rate which neither allows surface flooding nor the runoff, making water losses minimal. Fertilizers and  nutrients are also applied through this system and their losses made minimal by localized application  and reduced percolation. Manures and fertilizer application  Fertilizers may be applied in two split doses, one half immediately after the harvesting of fruits in June/ July and the other half in October, in both young and old orchards followed by irrigation if there are  no rains. Foliar application of 3 per cent urea in sandy soils is recommended before flowering. Well  decomposed farm-yard manure may be applied every year. For trench application of fertilizers, 400g.  each of N and K2O and 200g.of P2O5 per plant should be provided. Micro-nutrients may be applied as  per the requirement in the form of foliar sprays. Integrated Nutrient Management The continuous use or excess supply of inorganic fertilizers as source of nutrient in imbalanced  proportion is a problem, causing economic inefficiency, damage to the environment and in certain  situations harm the trees themselves. INM involves maintenance or adjustment of tree nutrient supply  to an optimum level for sustaining the desired fruit productivity.  Plant protection measures Mango hoppers First spray of carbaryl at the time of panicle emergence and second spray two weeks after first spray.  Wettable sulphur @ 2 g/lit may be sprayed after spraying carbaryl to avoid mite resurgence.

The first spray  comprising of wettable sulphur (0.2 per cent, i.e., 2 g per litre of water) should be done when the  panicles are 8-10 cm in size as a preventive spray.80 Figure 12.4: Mango orchards in Mallampet village of Kotapally mandal Figure 12.5: Leaf webbing by red ants Way Forward  Recent efforts in doubling of agricultural production have been successful through intensification  leading to increased yields per unit area. The potential for a further doubling in yields now attracts  increasing attention and research. There is need to revitalize yield growth in a sustainable manner  by reducing the inputs and using fewer resources. The current trend is to focus on ecological  intensification, sustainable intensification and evergreen revolution. Constraints are bound to occur  in the way including land and water, environmental degradation and climate change. A two way  schematic representation of how we must approach the issue of enhancing the productivity and yield  of mango without degrading the environment is presented in fig. 25 (Figure below). We must adopt  sub optimal tree and soil management practices to enhance the productivity and income of the farmers.  The challenge is how to apply good governance using existing agricultural sciences and technologies  without affecting the needed advances in tree productivity and yield. In this direction we must focus on  two main components. (i) the development of integrated soil orchard systems management, which will  address key constraints in existing tree management and; (ii) look for new ways that offer higher yields  but use less water, fertilizer or other inputs and insulate against drought, heat, submersion, and pests  and diseases. Conservation horticulture holds the key. Efforts must be made to create awareness among  mango farmers and popularize the concept of conservation horticulture to achieve the goal of enhanced  mango productivity.81 Application and extension of existing technologies Mango is national fruit and deserves a nationwide attention to achieve the top position in the world to  retain the title of national fruit and to help the farmers to make profit from mango orchards. Available  evidence suggests that the yield gap between average farm yields and the experiments yield on research  farms are derived from factors such as: (i) low profitability of mango production; (ii) limited access  to new orchard technologies and; (iii) poor soil and orchard management by farmers. We must focus  on a mission mode to adopt the available technologies of orchard management across the country to  enhance the productivity, yield and profitability of mango orchards and achieving the goal of doubling  the income of mango farmers (Figure 12.6) Figure 12.6: A two way schematic representation of approaches to enhance  the productivity and yield of mango.

Amarender Reddy and Jagati Yadagiri  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  India may be the world’s second largest producer of food, but it has its second largest undernourished  population. Further, more than half of women in India suffer from anemia, which is one of the reasons  for the high rate of low-birth weight babies. An unbalanced diet and lack of food is directly linked to  high rates of stunting, excessive weight, and death in children lesser than five years of age (Bhatta, et  al., 2008; Birdi and Shah, 2016). The Government of India has implemented programmes for providing  food security and ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food. There is a need to look at  multiple strategies to combat the issue of food security. Community and nutrition gardens can play  an important role in enhancing national food security and dietary diversity to combat malnutrition.  Fruits and vegetables from the kitchen gardens are good source of micro-nutrients especially in the  poor households. Rural areas have ample space and establishing a kitchen garden is far simpler as farm  families are involved in agriculture. Nutrition gardens are a micro-solution and an affordable way of ensuring healthy food and balanced  nutrition. Different studies on home gardens concludes it to be an effective and sustainable means  of improving nutritional standards of low-income rural families through integrated household food  production. Nutrition-gardening presents an innovative solution to ensure food security, employment of  youth, and an alternative way to generate extra income in developing countries.  In Mancherial district is carved out of erstwhile Adilabad district most of the rural villages lot of space  available for Nutrition gardens and some famlies are already involved in growing selected or few crops  like maize, gourds and beans. They are using only native seeds and one season for i.e., kharif for  growing vegetables in the backyard. There is lot of scope for diversification with different crops, seasons and improved seed for year around  production (Table 13.1 and Figure 13.1).83 Table 13.1: Crops suited for kitchen garden Fruits Vegetables Spices Medicinal plants Flowers Mango Banana Sapota Guava Papaya Acid lime Amla Pomegranate Anona Tomato Brinjal Chilli Onion Big onion Bhendi Bitter gourd Snake gourd Ribbed gourd Bottle gourd Amaranthus Lab lab Beetroot Radish Curry leaf Moringa Spinach Cluster bean Cowpea Tapioca Ash gourd Chilli Turmeric Coriander Fenugreek Ajwain Ginger  Aloe Mint Basil Tulsi Rose Marigold Jasmine Nerium Advantages of kitchen garden ► Supply fresh fruits and vegetables high in nutritive value ► Supply fruits and vegetables free from toxic chemicals ► Help to save expenditure on purchase of vegetables ► Vegetables harvested from home garden taste better than those purchased from market ► Effective utilization of kitchen waste water and kitchen waste materials ► Exercise to the body and mind Site selection ► Backyard of house ► Preferably open areas with plenty of sunlight near the water source84 Size and shape of vegetable garden depends on ► Availability of land ► Number of persons in family and ► Spare time available for its care ► Nearly five cents of land (200 m2) is sufficient to provide vegetables throughout year for a family  consisting of five members ► A rectangular garden is preferred than a square plot or a long strip of land Layout of kitchen garden ► Fence-barbed wire fence or live fence with agathi ► Perennial crops (Mango, Sapota, Acid lime, Amla, Morniga) should be planted at the peripheral  areas of kitchen garden (avoid shading) ► One or two compost pits may be provided on one corner ► Fences on all sides should be trained with cucurbitaceous vegetables (Bottle gourd, Bitter gourd and  Snake gourd) ► Some vegetables are direct sown-(Amaranthus, Bottle gourd, Bitter gourd and Snake gourd) ► Some vegetables are nursery transplanted (Tomato, Brinjal, Chillies and Onion) ► Divide the area into equal sized plots for raising annual vegetable crops ► As intensive and continuous cropping is done in a kitchen garden ► Fertility and texture of soil may be maintained by applying adequate quantities of organic manures  frequently ► Ridges and furrows are formed in each plots ► Season of planting: June-July and September-October ► Bee-hive may be provided for ensuring adequate pollination of crops besides obtaining honey ► However, in order to harvest good crop, chemical fertilizers are also essential ► Pick and destroy the larvae found on fruits and vegetables and then spray Neem oil @ 4 ml/liter of  water or Neem Seed Kernel Extract @ 3  per cent ► Avoid spraying of toxic chemicals85       Figure 13.1: Kitchen garden in villages of Kotapally mandal, Mancherial district References Bhatta, K.

Ramana and Prabhat Kumar Pankaj  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Livestock provides livelihood to two-third of rural community. It also provides employment to about  8.8 per cent of the population in India. India has vast livestock resources. Livestock sector contributes  4.11 per cent GDP and 25.6 per cent of total Agriculture GDP (Kumar et al., 2018: Vanam and Lakshmi,  2020). The livestock is especially important for providing regular source of income through dairy  animals, through sale of meat and chicken for small holder farmers (Ravichandran et al., 2020; Kumar  et al., 2020). However, productivity of Indian livestock is somewhat less than that of the world average  in milk and meat, etc. It might be due to low productive breeds, low quality sheds or feed and fodder  (Balehegn et al., 2020).  This chapter illustrates the population of various livestock by village, social group and land class  category and strategies for increasing incomes from the livestock. On an average, only 50 per cent of  the households own different types of livestock ranging from buffalo to poultry. About 47 per cent of the  households have bullocks, 25 per cent have poultry, 23 per cent have local cows, 20 per cent have young  cattle, 16 per cent have goats, 3 per cent have improved cows, 2 per cent have she-buffalo, about 1 per  cent have sheep, 0.79 per cent have he-buffalo and only 0.2 per cent have pigs (Figure 14.1).  Figure 14.1: Ownership of different types of livestock (in three villages together)87 Given that, only a few households have different types of livestock, in the following section, we are  presenting analysis of only households having animals. Analysis excludes the households who don’t  have animals.  Figure 14.2 illustrates the various types of livestock and their value. On average, households (averages  are calculated for households who have at least one animal in the respective category) in the study area  owned about 8 sheep, 5 goats, 3 male buffalo, 1-2 female buffalo, 2 bullocks and cows, 1-2 cross breed  cows and about 4 poultry. The livestock population in the villages are very diversified as they are used  for multiple purpose as draught animals, milk, meat, eggs, etc. In terms of value, bullock comes first  followed by female buffalo, goat, cross bred cows, sheep, local cows, male buffalo, young cattle, pigs  and poultry. It indicates, in the villages still draught animals play an important role in cultivation, hence  more number of bullocks.  Figure 14.2: Average number of livestock per household and their value  (Averages are calculated for the households having at least one animal in the respective category) Table 14.1 to 14.3 represents the livestock status in the study area by village, social group and landholding  class. The tables show the per cent of households possessing different type of livestock and average  number per household. On average, number of sheep are higher (about 7 to 8 per household), followed  by goat (4-5), poultry (3-4), male-buffalo (3), bullock (about 2), local cow and cross bred cow (1-2),  when we not take in to account households without livestock. Sheep rearing is done only in Mallampet  and Nagampet villages by scheduled caste and backward caste group villagers. Pigs are reared by only  one family who belongs to ST with marginal landholding in Nagampet village.88 Table 14.1: Pattern of farm livestock holding by village Village Edagatta Mallampet Nagampet All Livestock   (%) of hhs  owning  Average  per family  (nos.)

Female buffalos are being reared by SC, OBC and FC/OC household’s in Edagatta and  Mallampet villages. But the value of the breed reared by other caste group is almost double that of what  the SC household’s rear. Farmers of Edagatta and Nagampet village rear three male buffaloes by OBC  household’s only for breeding purpose. On average one to two bullocks are being raised by marginal,  small, medium and large farmers, albeit, the value of those raised by large farmers is greater than others.  In general, large farmers rear a greater number of bullocks and cows than small landholding farmers.  Landless and marginal farmers are rearing a greater number of sheep and goat relative to their land size.

Poultry, goats  and dairy farming is being taken up by the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward caste family  households. Value of goats, poultry birds and crossbred cows reared by the other-backward caste are  priced higher than those of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe. Although the count of livestock is  lower in case of large farmers as compared to others, they rear a greater number of large animals like  bullocks and cows and also cross bred cows. Goat farming is being taken up by the scheduled caste,  scheduled tribe and backward caste population of all the three village farmers across the land classes.  The major problem in livestock rearing is the majority are local bred with low yield potential (Figures  14.3 to 14.5). It is proposed that the improved breeds of goats and sheep as well as poultry to be  distributed under the SCSP along with distribution of seeds of improved fodder varieties for yearlong  availability of fodder.

Nagarjuna Kumar and Paladugu Praveen kumar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Technological adoption is driving force for increasing agricultural production, productivity and farm  incomes (Kassie et al., 2011). Farmers are also looking to new technologies as a way to reduce cost  of cultivation (Subramanian and Qaim, 2009). Technological adoption also will have wider area  wise impacts in terms of better livelihoods opportunities, increased wage employment and food and  nutritional security (Ward and Singh, 2015). In this chapter, we have examined the overall adoption  level of technology in terms of improved seed, fertilizer consumption per unit area, use of micro- nutrients and pesticides and also irrigation application. Since, we have covered crop wise data in earlier  chapter, in this chapter we have taken farm holding as a unit and examined overall adoption of these  technologies rather than crop wise. It gives overall indication of adoption rate of different technologies  on a broader scale in areas, among different social groups of farmers and also land-class wise.  A) Technology adoption in crop cultivation Adoption of technology in terms of use and quantity of different types of inputs like fertilizers in the  crops per unit area in the sample villages were examined village wise, social group and also land-class  are presented in Table 15.1 and Figure 15.3 and 15.4. In the sample villages, average seed sown per  acre is 2 bags/acre. Generally, the recommended dose is only one bag, but farmers are using two bags.  Farmers of the village on average use 2.9 bags of Urea, 2.3 bags of DAP and 1.8 bags of MoP/complex  fertilizers. On average, they use about one cart of FYM, less than one packet of micro-nutrients per acre.  On average, they apply irrigation about two times and pesticides about 3 times per crop season. There is  no significant difference among the villages, except that in Edagatta use of Urea, complex fertilizers and  pesticides are higher might be due to a more number of irrigations given to crops (Figure 15.1), which  will provide suitable conditions to use more inputs. Being remote, the farm mechanization and labour  availability was good enough to meet peak season demands for cotton picking, etc.  Table 15.1: Technology adoption in crops by village (overall) Village Edagatta Mallampet Nagampet All Seed (bag/acre) 1.9 2.2 1.9 2.0  Urea (bags/acre) 3.2 3.2 2.7 2.9  DAP (bags/acre) 1.3 2.5 2.5 2.3 MoP/Complex fertilizers (bags/acre) 2.3 1.6 1.7 1.8  FYM (carts/acre) 0.1 0.6 1.6 1.0  Micronutrient (packets/acre) 0.0 0.5 1.5 0.8 Irrigation (nos) 5.3 1.4 1.2 2.1 Pesticides (nos) 3.7 2.8 2.5 2.9 Note: The recommended dose of seed rate is one bag/acre for both cotton and paddy. One cotton seed bag contains 450 gm in  case of hybrids and 3 kg in case of varieties, while paddy seed bag contains 10 kg. Generally, one bag is recommended per one  acre in both cotton and paddy case. 1 bag Urea contains 45 kg, 1 bag DAP and MoP/complex fertilizers contain 50 kg each.92 Figure 15.1: Monitoring of the ground water in a horticultural garden SC farmers are using more of Urea and DAP, but less of the MoP/complex fertilizers, FYM, micro- nutrients and number of irrigations compared to other social groups. The use of more Urea and DAP  and less of MoP/complex and micro-nutrients may be an indication of traditional cultivation and inertia  to use new and modern inputs. This inertia to change to modern inputs and varieties among socially  backward farmers is observed in many earlier studies (Gupta et al., 2020).  Figure 15.2: Technology adoption in crop cultivation by social group (all crops)93 Unlike social groups, technology adoption rate is having strong positive relationship with landholding  size up to medium landholding size, there after there was slight decline for large landholders, especially  in adoption of Urea, DAP and MoP/complex fertilizers. It shows that, marginal and small holders don’t  have enough purchasing power to purchase these inputs, hence there is a need for modifications. Figure 15.3: Use of farm inputs by farm size (all crops) B) Technology adoption in Livestock Production Management (LPM) On average, about 50 per cent of the households own different types of livestock. About 47 per cent  of the households have bullocks, 25 per cent have poultry, 23 per cent have local cows, 20 per cent  have young cattle, 16 per cent have goats, 3 per cent have improved cows, 2 per cent have she-buffalo,  about 1 per cent have sheep, he-buffalo and only 0.2 per cent have pigs. Whereas, on average, 14.5 per  cent of the households in villages are keeping their livestock in sheds and vaccination to the animals  was carried out by only 11 per cent of the households. Technology adoption in livestock rearing by the  households is highest in Mallampet village with vaccination at 32 per cent, where as in Nagamepet and  Edagatta vaccination rate is very poor.  Access to vaccination was again in direct positive relationship with landholding size (Figure 15.4)  with very low vaccination by landless (4 per cent of households done vaccination for their animals)  and highest among large households with 22 per cent of the households. Interestingly vaccination  rates for animals are significantly better among SC households than ST households. Only a few are  using concentrate mixture for their livestock, low use of concentrate feed is the greatest hindrance in  improving productivity of animals. Artificial insemination is not at all practiced in the sample villages  which are also reflected in dominance of local breeds with low milk yielding capacity.  C) Animal shelter management Overall, only 15 per cent of the households are having livestock sheds.  A significant number of large  farmers have animal shelters, while the majority of small farmers don’t. It indicates the majority of the  households keep their animals in open places or under the trees.  Scientifically constructed livestock  shelters are very important to manage micro-climate for the animal’s health, comfort and convenience.  The properly constructed animal shelters are also easy to maintain and clean, reduce drudgery for farm  workers. Hence the study team identified animal shelter construction and management is one of the  interventions for improving animal health and productivity in the study villages.94 Figure 15.4: Percentage of household’s in technology adoption in livestock Overall, adoption level of technologies was on higher side for crop cultivation, with saturation in  adoption of improved variety seed, fertilizer and pesticides uses. However, they are using more of  nitrogenous fertilizers and less of potash and other micro-nutrients. Although, there is good animal  population, use of FYM is also very limited. In case of livestock, they are still practicing age old animal  husbandry practices. They rear mostly local breeds with low milk yielding capacity (Basunathe et al.,  2010). The vaccination rate has recently increased, only a few are using concentrate feed mixtures to  feed animals, a few are having separate shed for animals. There is a need of increasing vaccination, use  of concentrates artificial insemination to increase productivity of livestock (Rathod et al., 2017).  References Basunathe, V. K., Sawarkar, S.

Lavanya ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Majority of the Indian farmers are small and marginal and lack of  necessary capital to invest in agriculture  (Reddy, 2012; Kumar, 2013; Ramprasad, 2019). Hence, availability of credit at low interest rates are  crucial for adoption of various inputs and also to meet daily consumption needs. The availability of  credit determines input use pattern, technology adoption, investments in land development, cost of  cultivation and farm incomes (Cole, 2009; Reddy et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2021). In general farmers  first preference is formal sources like commercial banks, Regional Rural banks (RRBs), cooperatives,  then from the semi-formal institutions like Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and last preference is informal  sources like friends and family, traders, input dealers and moneylenders as they charge higher interest  rates. Since years, farmers have been taking credit from different sources as they are unable to get  optimum income from the agricultural activities. The credit behavior of the households by village,  social group and land class are discussed in this chapter. Figure 16.1 presents the per cent of household’s accessed credit during the study year. About 86 per cent  of household’s have taken credit atleast from any one source. Share of households who accessed credit  is low in Mallampet (79 per cent of household’s) and highest in Nagampet (90 per cent), access to credit  is higher among OBC household’s (91 per cent), while less among ST household’s (72 per cent) and  among SC household’s it was 86 per cent. Access to credit was lower at 73 per cent among landless and  marginal farmers (84 per cent) than small farmers (93 per cent). Overall, the Figures indicated that SC/ ST household’s and landless labour had less access to credit compared to other household’s.  Figure 16.1: Percentage of household’s access to credit by village, social group and land class96 Figure 16.2: Sources of finance in the study villages Figure 16.2, indicates sources of credit and the main source of credit in the villages are RRBs (55.2  per cent of the household’s accessed credit) followed by SHGs (43.3 per cent) and friends and relatives  (26.8 per cent). Access from commercial banks, cooperatives, moneylenders, input dealers and traders  are very less. Overall, the findings indicate that farmers are accessing credit from low interest charging  sources like RRBs, SHGs and friends and relatives compared to higher interest charging sources like  moneylenders (Figure 16.2 and 16.3).  Figure 16.3: Number of sources of credit taken by household’s by village, social group and land  class Taking credit from multiple sources is increasing, because they may not be getting the required amount  from single source. Although only 86 per cent of household’s have access to credit some are having  access to credit from 2-3 sources. Figure 16.3 presents number of sources from which farmers accessed  credit. Overall, 43 per cent accessed credit from single source, while 36 per cent accessed from 2  sources and 7 per cent accessed from 3 sources. About 14 per cent ST household’s, 10 per cent of small  and 11 per cent of medium size landholding category farmers accessed credit from three sources. 52 per  cent of landless, 44 per cent medium and 42 per cent small landholding farmers accessed credit from  two sources. Overall, the data indicate that taking loans from multiple sources are problem for small and97 medium farmers as well as ST household’s for others problem is not serious.  Table 16.1 presents different sources of credit by village, social group and land class. Overall, 55 per  cent household’s have accessed credit through RRBs, 43 per cent from SHGs, 27 per cent from friends  and relatives, 6 per cent from commercial banks and very few are taken from cooperatives and money  lenders. Among villages, in Edagatta RRBs and SHGs are dominant sources, friends and relatives also  played important role in Nagampet and Mallampet. Commercial bank is major source in Mallampet  especially for SC farmers and also to medium and large farmers. So, commercial banks are playing  major role in disbursing credit to SC farmers under priority sector credit target, especially to meet the  needs of agricultural investments.

The average outstanding credit was  highest at Rs.1,47,000 from money lenders in Nagampet, followed by Rs.1,27,000 from friends and  relatives again from Nagampet, Rs.1,11,000 from RRBs in Edagatta. Generally, loans from cooperatives  and SHGs are for smaller amounts between Rs.10,000 to Rs.60,000, whereas, from commercial banks,  RRBs, moneylenders and relatives are for larger amounts. Despite of having a high rate of interest the  money lenders remain a significant source of credit in all the three villages. It is also noted that, although  being a formal institution, the reach of cooperative societies and the commercial banks are very less,  which needs to be increased as they charge very less interest rates and also don’t follow extortion  methods for repayments. Many farmers are feeling that formal institutions are more of procedure bound  and more delay and less of customer friendly orientation, ask for many details and security, which may  force the farmers to rely on the informal money lenders even at higher interest rates. In our focus group  discussions, women expressed that SHG’s loans are life line for livelihoods and small businesses for  women (Figure 16.7).98 Figure 16.4: Outstanding credit of the household’s by village Figure 16.5: Source and amount of credit of the household’s by social group Figure 16.6: Outstanding credit of the household’s by land class category99    Figure 16.7: Interaction with SHG’s References Cole, S.

Amarender Reddy, C. A. Rama Rao and Y. L. Meghana  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Agriculture is a highly risky economic activity because of its heavy dependence on weather conditions  which underscores the need for insurance (Reddy, 2004; Suresh et al., 2017). Insurance is not only an  investment to increase income; it also helps to cope with the risk and improving standard of living of  agricultural livelihood (Gulati et al., 2018; Aditya et al., 2018). But the close look of the data in the  Figures 17.1 to 17.3 revealed the fact that most of the household’s are deprived of accessing any of the  crop or weather insurance. The crop insurance scheme is not even reaching the ‘FC/OC’ group and large farmers unless it was  compulsory and linked to crop loans. But it was also noticed in the village wise comparison that there  is a better coverage of insurance in Edagatta village compared to other villages. Figure 17.1: Crop insurance by village (Percentage) Figure 17.2: Crop insurance by social group101 Figure 17.3: Crop insurance by land size class category Figure 17.4: Percentage of household’s citing reason for not taking insurance A majority of the sample household’s of the three villages across the socio-economic groups have  quoted that the reasons for not opting to crop insurance is, they never felt the need for insurance as  they are not aware of the crop insurance product (Figure 17.4). The next major reason is as they are  tenant farmers, they are not able to take crop insurance as they don’t have necessary documents, some  farmers expressed that they don’t have money to pay premium during the sowing season as they have to  purchase other urgent inputs like seed and fertilizer, some of the farmers expressed that their holdings  are too small to take crop insurance and benefit from it, some farmers also expressed that they never  heard about crop insurance, insurance facility is not available and due to lack necessary information.  Some farmers expressed that they don’t trust private company who issue policies at the village. It  is important to note that despite the overarching central schemes for crop insurance, 17 per cent of  Mallampet villagers, 8.3 per cent of scheduled caste and 5 to 10 per cent of small, medium and marginal  farmers don’t feel the need for crop insurance. The above results indicate that the main reason for not  taking crop insurance is lack of awareness, eligibility and lack of money for payment of premium.102 References Aditya, K.

Ramanjul Reddy ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Food security Food security historically referred to the overall regional, national, or even global food supply and  shortfalls in supply compared to requirements. But, with increased observation of insufficient food  intake by certain groups (despite overall adequacy of food supply), the term has more recently been  applied mostly at a community, local, household or individual level (Weingärtner, 2009). Further, the  term has been broadened beyond notions of food supply to include elements of access, vulnerability,  and sustainability (Chambers 1989; Reddy, 2016). According to a currently accepted definition (FAO 2000), ‘Food Security’ is achieved when it is ensured  that “all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious  food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”. Food is here  defined as any substance that people eat and drink to maintain life and growth. As a result, safe and  clean water is an essential part of food commodities. The nutrition focus adds the aspects of caring practices and health services and healthy environments  to this definition and concept. This aims at what is more precisely called ‘Nutrition Security’, which  can be defined as adequate nutritional status in terms of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals for all  household members at all times (Quisumbing 1995). Now, after incorporating nutrition aspects “Food and nutrition security is achieved, if adequate food  (quantity, quality, safety, socio-cultural acceptability) is available and accessible for and satisfactorily  used and utilized by all individuals at all times to live a healthy and active life.” This definition combines  Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) and emphasizes several aspects, i.e., ‘Availability’, ‘Accessibility’,  and ‘Use and Utilization’ of food. The inclusion of the use and utilization aspect underscores the fact  that ‘Nutrition Security’ is more than ‘Food Security.’ Figure 18.1: Conceptual framework for food security Source: FAO (1996)104 Aspects of Food and nutrition security The conceptual framework of food security Figure 18.1, illustrates the relationship among the various  elements of food security. Two factors influence the framework: a physical and a temporal factor. The  physical determinant is the food flow: Availability, Accessibility, Use and Utilization. The temporal  determinant of FNS refers to stability, which affects all three physical elements.  In this context availability refers to the physical existence of food, be it from own production or on the  markets. On national level food availability is a combination of domestic food production, commercial  food imports, food aid, and domestic food stocks, as well as the underlying determinants of each of  these factors. Use of the term availability is often confusing, since it can refer to food supplies available  at both the household level and at a more aggregate (regional or national) level. However, the term is  applied most commonly in reference to food supplies at the regional or national level. Access is ensured when all household’s and all individuals within those household’s have sufficient  resources to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. It is dependent on the level of household  resources-capital, labour, and knowledge and on prices. Note that adequate access can be achieved  without households being self-sufficient in food production. More important is the ability of household’s  to generate sufficient income which, together with own production, can be used to meet food needs.  Food access also is a function of the physical environment, social environment and policy environment  which determine how effectively households are able to utilize their resources to meet their food security  objectives. Drastic changes in these conditions, such as during periods of drought or social conflict,  may seriously disrupt production strategies and threaten the food access of affected household’s. To  the extent that these shocks often lead to the loss of productive assets such as livestock, they also have  severe implications for the future productive potential of household’s and, therefore, their long-term  food security.  Use of food refers to the socio-economic aspect of household food security. If sufficient and nutritious  food is both available and accessible the household has to make decisions concerning what food is to  be purchased, prepared and consumed (demanded) and how the food is allocated within the household.  In household’s where distribution is unequal, even if the measured aggregate access is sufficient, some  individuals may suffer from food deficiency. The same is true if the composition of the consumed food  is unbalanced. Another aspect is the social function that food can have in terms of community cohesion  through offerings, ritual meals etc., especially in food deficit times. All these socio-economic aspects  are determined by knowledge and habits. This is especially critical for feeding infants (breast feeding,  weaning foods etc.). Focusing on the individual level food security also requires taking the biological utilization of food  into consideration. This refers to the ability of the human body to take food and convert it into either  energy which is either used to undertake daily activities or is stored. Utilization requires not only an  adequate diet, but also a healthy physical environment, including safe drinking water and adequate  sanitary facilities (so as to avoid disease) and an understanding of proper health care, food preparation,  and storage processes.  Stability or sustainability refers to the temporal dimension of nutrition security i.e., the time frame  over which food security is being considered. In much of the food security literature, a distinction  is made between chronic food insecurity-the inability to meet food needs on an ongoing basis-and105 transitory food insecurity when the inability to meet food needs is of a temporary nature (Maxwell  and Frankenberger 1992). Transitory food insecurity is sometimes divided into two subcategories: (i)  cyclical, where there is a regular pattern to food insecurity, e.g., the ‘lean season’ or ‘hungry season’  that occurs in the period just before harvest and; (ii) temporary, which is the result of a short-term,  exogenous shock such as droughts or floods.  Conceptual framework for malnutrition  Figure 18.2 shows the conceptual framework of malnutrition, developed by UNICEF and widely  accepted at the international level. It is mainly used in the context of under-nutrition in rural areas  of developing countries. According to this framework, malnutrition occurs as a result of a number of  factors which directly and indirectly cause malnutrition. The immediate causes of the nutritional status  manifest themselves at the level of the individual human being. These are dietary intake and health  status. These factors themselves are interdependent. Dietary intake must be adequate in quantity and  in quality, and nutrients must be consumed in appropriate combinations for the human body to be able  to absorb them (energy, protein, fat, and micro-nutrients). On household level the decision what food  is being put on the table (demand) and who is to eat it (intra-household distribution) determines the  composition of the meals for the individual. Habits (e.g. food taboos) and knowledge (e.g. preparation,  processing, child feeding practices) influence the composition but also the biological utilization of the  food. There are strong synergistic relationships between the health status and the nutritional status. A  poorly nourished person has a weakened immune system and is more prone to infections. Infections  increase the potential for and severity of malnutrition.  Figure 18.2: Conceptual framework for malnutrition (UNICEF, 1991)  as reported in Weingärtner (2009).106 Figure 18.3, depicts a simplified causal model of linking nutritional status with causal factors at  household level. In this conceptual framework, the nutritional status is an outcome of food intake and  health status. However, the underlying causes of health-environmental causes and health services-have  been depicted in different boxes due to their different natures. A reduced state of health may be due  in part to tenuous access to health care, poor housing and environmental conditions, and is possibly  worsened by malnutrition, which predispose individuals to diseases. The distinction between health  services and environment is necessary to select appropriate intervention strategies. Figure 18.3: Conceptual framework of the nutrition status at household level Source: Weingärtner, L. (2009) Application to local situation In this section, we try to apply the above concept to assess household food and nutritional security. We  have canvassed special questionnaire to understand the food consumption habits of the representative  household’s along with anthropometric indicators like height, weight etc.  The food availability in local conditions determined by the food production, purchases and government  schemes like Public Distribution System (PDS) for household’s. In addition to the above child and  women food and nutritional availability depends also on effective functioning of Anganwadi centers  and Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) centers. The Anganwadi center is a place where  parents feel safe leaving their kids to go to work, and it keeps unattended children off the streets. The  ICDS centers provide nutritional meals, preschool education, primary healthcare, immunization, health  check-up and referral services to children under 6 years of age and their mothers. Existing situation of food habits  Kotapally mandal is situated in Mancherial district which is predominantly agrarian society. The major  crops grown are cotton and paddy. There is a well-functioning ration shop deliver subsidised rice for  each below poverty household. Hence, availability of rice is not a problem for majority of household’s.  Many household’s directly involved in farming and mostly grow paddy and to some extent pulses and  other food items within their farms. So, they are not directly exposed to price uncertainty.107 Majority of the household’s maintain kitchen gardens in the villages. They grow leafy vegetables,  pigeon pea, beans, tomato, bhendi and brinjal for their household consumption. Some farmers are  also growing desi poultry, goat and sheep for the meat purpose mostly for household consumption.  Sometimes, surplus is marketed in the local weekly market to purchase other household items. Some  household’s are also maintaining dairy animals for milk purpose, they are also selling surplus milk  locally at reasonable price, the money received from milk is again used for purchasing farm inputs and  hiring agricultural labour.  The general food habits of the villagers are morning breakfast in which they consume mostly idli, dosa,  puri etc., along with tea or coffee. Afternoon they consume mainly rice along with at least one vegetable,  sometimes with pulses and sambhar. Pulses and green leafy vegetables were consumed weekly twice.  During the dinner again they consume rice along with vegetables and curd. Majority are not using  millets and other diversified foods. Consumption of fruits are infrequent, only a few household’s that  too weekly once or twice. On average, per capita consumption per month was 10 kg of rice, 1 kg of  pulses, 1.75 kg edible oils and 0.6 kg green leafy vegetables. On average, monthly once or twice they  eat chicken or meat, with about 0.6 kg per person per month. Milk was consumed daily, on average  2.43 liters per month per capita. Overall, it appears that the proportion of calories coming from cereals  like rice is much higher, while protein consumption was much less. Since most of the household’s are  having kitchen gardens, they consume significant amount of vegetables, which meet their fiber and  nutritional needs. Anthropometric indicators Average age of the head of the household is 48.8 years, with 5.24 feet height and 49.78 kg weight.  While among adult females, average age is 40.9 years, height is 4.9 feet and weight is 41.8 kg. Children  appeared to be undernourished, although they have Anganwadi and mid-day meal schemes intended  to provide nutritious food for at least once a day. The Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated as per the  standard formula (BMI = kg/m2) for sample household’s for both husband and wife to see the gender  differences. It is reported that in most of the household’s BMI is more or less similar for male and  female within the family, in some families female BMI is less than desirable. No one is in overweight  range (Figure 18.4).  Figure 18.4: Body Mass Index for male and female in the same family108 Problem analysis  The study team find out that there is a significant undernourishment especially among women and  children from both secondary sources and which were supported by primary data collection. A detailed  analysis of the problem was done by drawing fishbone diagram of problem analysis, diagnosis and  dissection (Figure 18.5). The major cause of undernourishment are poverty, irregular incomes, low crop  yields, unhealthy food habits like excessive proportion of rice compared to fruits and vegetables and  infectious diseases.

Narsimlu ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The scheduled caste communities are most backward population in India. They are historically neglected  since centuries, to compensate this historical negligence, the Government of India (GoI) proactively  taking steps to increase their socio-economic status. Among the many programmes, SC-Sub Plan is one  with more concentrated efforts to increase farmers’ income. The strategy of SCSP consists of important  interventions through planning process for social, educational and economic development of Scheduled  Castes and also for improvement in their working and living conditions. Under the Scheduled Castes Development Bureau (SCDB), the Government of India is implementing  Schedules Caste Sub-Plan (SCSP) which is an umbrella strategy to ensure flow of targeted financial and  physical benefits from all the general sectors of development for the benefit of Scheduled Castes. Under  the strategy, each implementing agency is required to formulate and implement Special Component  Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes as part of their Annual Plans by earmarking resources. At present 27  States/UTs having sizeable SC population are implementing Schedules Caste Sub-Plan. Objective of the Scheme The main objective is to give a thrust to family-oriented schemes of economic development of SCs  below the poverty line, by providing resources for filling the critical gaps and for providing missing  vital inputs so that the schemes can be more meaningful. Since the schemes/programmes for SCs may be  depending upon the local occupational pattern and the economic activities available, the implementing  agencies have been given a reasonable flexibility in utilizing funds with the only condition that it should  be utilized benefit SC households. The implementing agencies have been given flexibility in choice of  activities to be implemented, within the overall framework of the scheme. Scheduled Castes Sub Plan  (SCSP) is a central scheme under which 100 per cent grant is given to the implementing agencies. ICAR-CRIDA is implementing the SC-Sub plan in Mancherial district of Telangana state with the  aim of doubling farmer’s income (DFI) within a five year period. A special focus has been given to  inclusive growth especially in empowering women farmers, educated unemployed youth through skill  development and entrepreneurship development.  Regular meetings are conducted to examine the feasibility and viability of the activities planned  for improving the farmer’s incomes. Regular field visits by scientist of  ICAR-CRIDA, Hyderabad  to examine the shortcomings/loopholes in implementation and taking corrective steps were planned  within the action plan. Identification of viable schemes as per the developmental needs of SCs and  identification of eligible beneficiaries to be considered for assistance in a financial year will be finalized  by the SC communities themselves which will be facilitated by the CRIDA team.110 The skill developing training programmes will be conducted with the support of other line departments  like NIRD, ICAR Institutes, etc., and formulated in such a way that after the completion of training, the  placement of trained candidates either in waged employment or in self-employment is ensured. Follow  up of the beneficiaries after the planned activities will be conducted to ascertain whether they have  acquired necessary assets and utilizing the assets for income generating activities. ICAR-CRIDA team  will do all efforts for ensuring full utilization of SC-Sub Plan funds and effective implementation of  scheme for the benefit of the target group. NRM based development activities Mancherial district has been classified as Agro Ecological Sub Regions (7.3) and is characterized  by semiarid climate with farming situation of vertisols/alfisols and 1150 mm precipitation and the  major cropping pattern of cotton followed by rice during kharif season and rice fallows during rabi.  However, agricultural productivity in the region is very poor due to lack of water resources during  the terminal drought situation in spite of good annual average rainfall. Water resources development  through rejuvenation of percolations tanks, proper shaping of PTs, desliting, application of silt on crop  lands and bunds of PTs. Micro irrigations systems (Drip, Sprinklers etc.,) for increasing the water  use efficiency. Introduction of multicropping system like cotton crop in catchment area, on bunds and  paddy in command area. Utilisation of residual moisture for rabi crops like bengal gram, safflower and  chickpea  etc., and relay cropping in water storage area of PTs with black gram, green gram and horse  gram and also introduction of aquaculture.

The SCs are sometimes  referred to as Dalit. The Scheduled Castes comprise about 16.6 per cent of India’s population (according  to the 2011 census). The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 lists 1,108 castes across 28 states  in its First Schedule. For much of the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent, they were known  as the “Depressed Classes”. Since the independence of India, the SCs were given Reservation status,  guaranteeing political representation. The Constitution lays down the general principles of positive  discrimination for SCs. The Constitution provides a three-pronged strategy to improve the situation of SCs: Protective arrangements: Such measures as are required to enforce equality, to provide punitive  measures for transgressions, and to eliminate established practices that perpetuate inequities.  Affirmative action: Provide positive treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education as a  means to accelerate the integration of the SCs with mainstream society.  Development: Provide resources and benefits to bridge the socioeconomic gap between the SCs and  other communities. Legislation to improve the socioeconomic situation of SCs because twenty-seven  per cent of SC households lived below the poverty line, compared to the mere eleven percent among  other households. Additionally, these castes were poorer than other groups in Indian society, and they  suffered from higher morbidity and mortality rates as per the National Commission for Scheduled  Castes. However, in spite of planned development and prioritization of scheduled caste households in various  development schemes, there are various reports, which pointed out that there is underutilization of  funds and intended benefits were not reached to the targeted households. To address the problem of  underutilization of the allocated budget for SC upliftment, the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SCSP)  program was initiated by the Government of India.  The SCSP mandated a planning process for the social, economic and educational development of SCs  and improvement in their working and living conditions. It was an umbrella strategy, ensuring the flow  of targeted financial and physical benefits from the general sector of development to the Scheduled  Castes. It entailed a targeted flow of funds and associated benefits from the annual plan of union  government in at least a proportion to the national SC population. Twenty-seven states and UTs with  sizable SC populations are implementing the plan. Objective of the Scheme The main objective of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) - Central Research  Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad component of the SCSP programme is to identify  major problems faced by the SC households in these three villages to come out of poverty and plan,  prioritize and implement household-oriented schemes for overall socio-economic development. ICAR- CRIDA will provide resources and technical support to fill the critical gaps and by providing vitaliv inputs to achieve the target of improved livelihoods, socio-economic development. Since the schemes/ programmes for SCs depends on the local occupational pattern, economic activities and resource  endowments, the implementing agencies have been given flexibility in utilizing the funds with the  only condition that it should be utilized in conjunction with SCSP and other resources available from  various line departments like agricultural and rural development departments, various corporations and  financial institution etc. National Institution for Transforming India\\xa0(NITI) Aayog guidance, ICAR notified Kotapally mandal  of Mancherial erstwhile while Adilabad for overall development of scheduled caste households in a  time bound manner with specific budget allocation. As in the Kotapally mandal share of SC population  in total population was higher at 25 per cent, while in the district their share is only 15 per cent and only  16.6 per cent in India as per the Census 2011. Upon receiving the approval, the study team of ICAR- CRIDA visited the mandal and identified three villages for developmental intervention for intensive  development of the SC households.  The CRIDA team adopted a unique approach called “Problem Driven Iterative Adoption” where  in the team has identified the problems faced by the SC households, diagnosed and dissected these  problems and evolved solution in partnership with the local stakeholders, mainly farmers. This baseline survey is a part of identifying the specific problems of the farmers and identify solutions  in partnership with the farmers. The specific approach followed under the PDIA is given below.

Osman and G. Ravindra Chary  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The concept of Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) was envisaged by the erstwhile Planning Commission  of India (now National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, New Delhi) at the time of  formulation of Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85) with the objective to ensure adequate benefits under  SCSP for socio-economic and educational development of Scheduled Castes (SCs) both in physical and  financial terms by providing funds, out of total allocation of the State Plan, at least in proportion to the  percentage of SC population in the state (Dushkin, 1967; Planning Commission, 2007; Pattenden, 2011;  Bhagavatheeswaran, et al., 2016; Acharya and Sahoo, 2019). The SCSP is designed to channelize the flow of benefits and outlays from the general sectors in the plan  of the states and central ministries for the development of scheduled castes in physical and financial  terms.  These plans are envisaged to help poor Scheduled Castes families through composite income generating  programmes during the Sixth Plan period (1980-85). Such family-oriented programmes are to cover  all the major occupational groups amongst scheduled castes such as agricultural labourers, small  and marginal farmers, share-croppers, fishermen, sweepers and scavengers and urban un-organized  labourers below the poverty line. Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJ & E) is providing 100 per cent grant under the  Central Sector Scheme of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) as  an additive to SCSP to the States/UTs to fill the critical gaps and vital missing inputs in family-oriented  income generating schemes with supporting infrastructure development so as to make the schemes  more effective. The objective of the SCA is to provide additional support to Below Poverty Line (BPL)  SC families to enhance their productivity and income. SCA could also be utilized for infrastructural  development in the blocks having 50 per cent or more of SC population. SCA is released to these States/ UTs on the basis of the following weightage criteria: (i)  SC Population of the States/UTs: 40 per cent  (ii)  Relative backwardness of the States/UTs: 10 per cent  (iii)  Percentage of SC families in the States/UTs covered by Composite economic development  programmes in the State Plan to enable them to cross the poverty line: 25 per cent  (iv)  Percentage of SCSP to the Annual Plan as compared to SC population percentage of the States/ UTs: 25 per cent2 SCSP implemented by ICAR-CRIDA One of the major problems identified for widespread poverty among SC households is low adoption of  modern technologies by the households and consequent low productivity and low household incomes.  Considering the potential of agriculture and livelihoods improvements among the SC households, Indian  Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is implementing SCSP in few selected districts of different  states. In each district a mandal or taluka has been identified which is having more than 40 per cent of  population of SC Communities. In Telangana state, Kotapally mandal of Mancherial district (erstwhile  Adilabad) has been identified for implementation of SC-Sub Plan by ICAR-CRIDA as in the mandal  share of SC population in total population was higher at 25 per cent, while their share was only 15 per  cent in the Mancherial district, 20 per cent in Telangana state and 16.6 per cent in India.  In this context, ICAR-CRIDA also received SCSP guidelines and funds for implementing SC-Sub Plan  and the Institute is implementing this in the identified Kotapally mandal. The plan was started in the last  quarter of 2018-19 and is being continued during the current financial year (2021-22). Three villages  having more than 40 per cent of SC population have been identified by ICAR-CRIDA in collaboration  with Department of Agriculture namely Mallampet, Nagampet and Edagatta for taking interventions  related to agriculture, horticulture, poultry and entrepreneurship and small business activities under  this plan. Later, the SCSP interventions by ICAR-CRIDA team were extended to the remaining 31  villages in the mandal. The names of the villages covered are Nakkalpalle, Brahmanpalle, Shankarpur,  Shetpalle, Pangadisomaram, Kotapalle, Vesonvai, Sarvaipet, Kondampet, Bopparam, Venchapalle,  Supak, Jangaon, Algaon, Pullagaon, Sirsa, Edula Bandam, Lingannapet, Pinnaram, Parpalle, Yerraipet,  Borampalle, Kawarkothapalle,  Annaram,  Arjungutta, Rajaram, Rampur, Kollur, Rawalpalle, Dewalwada  and Rapanpalle (Table 1.1). Three villages namely Chintakunta, Ayepalle and Adkapalle are with no  habitation of population. Table 1.1: Village wise population in Kotapally mandal (2011 census) S.

The  goals may be increase in crop production, conservation of soil and water etc. Building local capabilities  for improving local communities’ capabilities needs constant support to formal (like Panchayat Raj  institutions) and informal (like farmers groups, women groups and youth groups) institutions and  individuals within and outside of government. Community based approaches and approaches which  build trust and relationships within community to take up activities like constriction of community  ponds is vital for sustainable development of villages. Under the SC-sub plan, one of the important  objectives of ICAR-CRIDA is to strengthen local capabilities to take up community wide development  programmes for the benefit of each and every one in the community.  The table 1.2 provides capability  matrix, which indicates the capability levels of different stakeholders in solving the prioritized problems.  In the table, green colour indicates the strong capability of individual/organization to solve the problems  in specific prioritized area, while red colour indicates weak capability, which needs to be improved  through training programmes and skill development.5 Table 1.2: Capability matrix: strengths and weakness matrix of stakeholders  Priority area  Individuals/organizations/institutions Credit  Individuals  Cooperatives  Commercial banks  Money lenders  Agricultural  technology  Farmers  ICAR- CRIDA Department of agriculture  KVK Kitchen garden  Households  ICAR- CRIDA Department of horticulture  KVK Nutrition  Households  Aanganwadis Integrated Child  Development Scheme  (ICDS) ICAR-CRIDA Soil health  Farmers  ICAR- CRIDA Department of agriculture  KVK Water  conservation   Farmers  ICAR- CRIDA District Rural  Development Agency  (DRDA) KVK Note: Red colour indicates weak capability, yellow indicates moderate; green indicates strong;  Source: Focus group interactions with key stakeholders References Acharya, S., & Sahoo, H.

Nirmala, K. Nagasree , A. Amarender Reddy and R. Nagarjuna Kumar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  A multipronged strategy was followed by involving a multidisciplinary team. Along with ICAR-CRIDA  Scientist’s, officials from line departments such as department of agriculture and rural development  were also involved in the implementation of the scheme. The basic strategy was illustrated in Figure 2.1.  Figure 2.1: Strategies/activities planned for improvement of SC farming community7 Entry Point Activities In order to gain confidence of all the stakeholders, especially among SC farming community, women  farmers, women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and youth, ICAR-CRIDA scientists and project team  organized a number of Village wise focus group discussions with each group separately and also in  larger group. The main objectives of these focus group interactions are: (i)  To understand the existing socio-economic condition of the villagers (ii)  To understand the availability and use of basic amenities and public facilities (iii)  To assess the livelihoods and cropping pattern of the farmers (iv)  To understand the problems faced by the farmers in farming and also in adopting various  livelihoods strategies (v)  To assess the technological adoption levels and problems in adoption by the farmers (vi)  To understand farm, off-farm and non-farm employment and incomes sources (vii)  To plan and prioritize development pathways  Gram Sabha’s and Focus Group Discussions In order to understand and identify major problems faced by the SC community, SCSP implementation  committee organized the Gram Sabha and constituted an advisory committee named “SC Sankshema  Samithi” in each selected village (Figure 2.2), in this committee there was adequate representation of  weaker section of the community within SC households like women farmers, disabled and women- headed households.  These Samithi members were active in all activities undertaken like soil and water management  measures, distribution of improved varieties of seed, horticultural planting material, procuring and  rearing improved breeds of livestock and poultry, starting of custom hiring centre and procurement of  farm implements and identification of farmers for training programs etc. Figure 2.2: Gram Sabha’s and FGD’S to understand the local problems,  prioritise and plan the activities8 The overall approach followed by ICAR-CRIDA in the implementation of the SC-Sub Plan in the  selected villages is adopted from Problem Driven Iterative Adoption (PDIA) as illustrated in Figure 2.3  (Andrews et al., 2013; Rao, 2014; Andrews et al., 2015). Figure 2.3: Adopted Problem Driven Iterative Adoption (PDIA) approach  for implementation of the SC-Sub Plan  Source: https://buildingstatecapability.com/tag/pdia-course/page/5/ PDIA emphasizes a problem-driven, iterative approach, which involve essential principles viz., (i)  identification of burning problems, solving defined problems through; (ii) creating an environment  amenable to experimentation; (iii) creating tight feedback loops and; (iv) engaging a broad set of actors.  The Figures 2.3 and 2.4 illustrates the various steps involved in the PDIA approach for development.  Past experience shows that successful development schemes have mostly followed PDIA principles,9 though these may not have been acknowledged explicitly. The PDIA approach is based on solving a  particular performance problem in a specific process. Here the problems are poverty, low agricultural  productivity and low farmer’s incomes.  Figure 2.4: Problem Driven Iterative Adoption cycle adopted to SCSP implementation  by ICAR-CRIDA Source: https://www.intdevalliance.scot/application/files/5715/0211/8537/MEL_Support_Package_4th_June.pdf Methodology of organising the baseline survey  Immediately after the identification of the intervention villages, the study team conducted baseline  survey. The baseline survey was carried out in year 2019 for the crop year 2018-19, before any type  of intervention. A detailed questionnaire was developed in consultation with all the different subject  matter experts to cover all aspects of the farmer’s basic-socio-economic and technological status before  the implementation of the SC-Sub plan programme in the villages. The questionnaire covered fourteen  sections covering (i) location details: farmer-household basic information; (ii) access to basic amenities  like bus stand, school, bank etc.; (iii) extent of use of public amenities and other government welfare  and development schemes like Soil Health Card, Rythu Bandhu (direct money transfer based on cropped  area); (iv) family details like age, education, occupation, income and employment; source of income and  employment pattern (like income from crops, livestock, agricultural labourer, non-farm employment,  migration and other sources); (v) landholding pattern like extent of owned land, leased-in land, leased- out land and total operational holding with extent of dryland and wet land; (vi) cropping pattern by  season and by irrigation status; (vii) general living standards like owning two wheeler/four wheeler,10 mobile, TV, refrigerator, electricity; (viii) type of farm machinery owned including desi plough, seed  drill, drip irrigation, sprayers, tractors etc., (ix) ownership of different livestock like bullocks, buffalo,  cows, goat and sheep; (x) credit behaviour of the farmers which include amount and source of credit  and interest rates both from formal and informal sources; (xi) insurance (awareness about insurance  scheme) especially the ongoing crop insurance scheme (Prime Minister Fasal Bhima Yojana), (xii)  benefits received from the different development and welfare schemes, (xiii) technology adoption in  major crops (like improved seed, fertilizer use, use of micro-nutrients, pesticide use, harvest and post- harvest practices), (xiv) technology adoption in livestock sector like owning good shed for livestock,  use of concentrated mixture, artificial insemination and vaccination. The questionnaire is attached in  Annexure 1. The questionnaire was pre-tested in the study villages and rectified for any corrections based on a set of  criteria developed by OECD (OECD, 2008) like (i) clear meaning; (ii) data is easily available; (iii) less  effort in data collection and does not require expert analysis; (iv) sufficiently representative for the total  of the intended results; (v) tangible and observable and; (vi) if difficult to quantify but very important  (in this case a proxy indicator was used to capture the approximate value of the intended variable). A total of ten data collection staff was recruited and trained for data collection. The data collection was  done in two month’s, later the data was complied, tabulated and analysed to draw the references and  conclusion. There part is prepared which was to be used as ready recknoer for planning intension during  the project period of September and October 2019.  References Andrews, M., Pritchett, L., & Woolcock, M.

Nagarjuna Kumar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The SC Sub Plan programme of Government of India is implemented across all the states by different  implementing agencies. As a part of it, ICAR-CRIDA implemented it in Mancherial district of Telangana  State as in the district SC population share is significantly higher and most of them are living in below  poverty line. In general, backward districts like Mancherial received very little public investment and  development expenditure since long in Telangana (Melkote et al., 2010 and Rao, 2014). In this chapter  general socio-economic and demographic and agricultural profile of the study area was illustrated.  I. Area Mancherial district is carved out of erstwhile Adilabad district of Telangana state. It is located in  northern Telangana bordering Maharashtra with highest share in forest area and scheduled tribe and  scheduled caste population. It is surrounded by Asifabad (Komaram Bheem), Adilabad, Nirmal, Jagityal,  Peddapalli, Bhoopalapally districts and the Maharashtra state (Figure 3.1). The district comprises of 18  mandals, two revenue divisions - Mancherial and Bellampalli and 382 villages. The district Headquarters  is located at Mancherial town. Figure 3.1: Telangana state map with Mancherial district Mancherial is well connected through its roadways and railways. Mancherial is one of the A category  railway stations of Secunderabad division and Bellampalli is also a major railway station in the district  (details of the district is given in Annexure 2). The state highway (SH1), national highway (NH63) and12 Nagpur highways run through the district, making the entire region well linked. It has one State Road  Transport Corporation (RTC) bus depot at Mancherial. Rivers Godavari and Pranahita pass through it.  Paddy is the major crop in the district, recently cotton area was increased. Housing a precious coal belt,  the district is home to Singareni Collieries and Jaipur Thermal Power Plant. It also possesses several  private cement manufacturers and ceramics factories. The ceramic pipe industry, which is the largest in  the in the country, is definitely an icing on the cake. Mancherial district boasts of the crocodile sanctuary  near Chennur and thick forest under a part of the Kawal Tiger Reserve. Gudemgutta Sri Satyanarayana  Swami Temple is a noted pilgrim centre in the district (Figure 3.2 and 3.3). Figure 3.2: Kotapally mandal headquarters with location of three study villages  identified for baseline survey demarcated Figure 3.3: Geographical location of villages identified for baseline survey,  with demarcation of nearest Chennur town13 II. Demography As per Census 2011, Mancherial district is having a population density of 201/sq. km, as against the  state average which is 312/sq. km. The total population of the district is 8,07,037 which accounts for 2.3  per cent of the total population of the State. The rural population accounts for 56 per cent. (4,53,151)  of the total population in the district. The total number of households is 2,06,983. So, the average  household size is 3.8. The sex ratio (females per 1,000 males) is 977. The total literacy rate is 64  per  cent in the district. The female literacy percentage is quite low (55.59 per cent) compared to the male  literacy rate (73 per cent) in the district. The share of workers in total population is 43 per cent. Total  scheduled caste population is just 15.5 per cent in the state, while their share was 25 per cent in the  district. Overall, the Mancherial district is little more urbanised than Telangana state, but having more  gender discrimination with lower sex ratio than the state, having more SC population and low density  of population (Figure 3.1).

District Agricultural Profile Climate Mancherial district falls under agroclimatic zone of Northern Telangana Zone. Normal annual rainfall of  this district is 1,065 mm, during South West Monsoon (rainy season spanning from June to September)  average rainfall is 953.20 mm, North East Monsoon (October to December) average 69.4 mm, during  winter season average rainfall is 7.60 mm and during hot period (summer) average rainfall is 28.9 mm.  Average annual temperature on average ranges between maximum 34.9 0C and minimum 22.0 0C with  mean hottest temperature 42.6 0C and the average relative humidity varies from 61-90 per cent. The  soils are of clayey to gravelly clayey, moderately deep dark brown soils, loamy to clayey skeletal deep  reddish-brown soils and shallow loamy to gravelly clay red soils. Many village tanks in the district are  renovated under Mission Kakatiya (tank renovation scheme of Telangana state), but still maintenance  is not proper (Figure 3.4).  Figure 3.4: Tank in Nagampet village (before renovation) in Mancherial district Agriculture Mancherial district is predominantly agrarian based. It has been a home for Gondi people who mainly  depend on agricultural activities for their livelihood. Later the district became industrialised by the  establishment of coal mines. But still the people engaged with agriculture (cultivation and agricultural  labour) make up to 56 per cent of total work population.  (Source: https://mancherial.telangana.gov.in/documents/). Landholding pattern in the district is similar to that of the Telangana state. A large number of populations  hold up to 1 ha of land and only 0.39 per cent of the population operates 10 ha and above landholding  (Table 3.2).15 Table 3.2: General characteristics of Telangana state and Mancherial district  S.No. Parameters Telangana state Mancherial district 1 Land holdings a) Marginal (up to 1 ha)  34,20,202 (62.0) 92,733 (63.8) b) Small (1-2 ha)  13,18,390 (23.9) 30,723 (21.1) c) Semi-medium (2-4 ha)  5,98,145 (10.8) 16,756 (11.5) d) Medium (4-10 ha)  1,65,127 (3.0) 4,654 (3.2) e) Large (10 ha and above)  15,647 (0.3) 581 (0.4) Total 55,17,511(100) 1,45,447 (100) 2 Cropped area (ha.) a) Gross cropped Area (GCA) 48,93,148 95,568 b) Net cropped Area (NCA) 41,74,532 84,931 c) Gross irrigated Area (GIA) 20,27,663 30,698 d) Net irrigated Area (NIA) 14,86,241 30,698 e) Cropping intensity (GCA/NCA)*100 117 113 f) Irrigation intensity (GIA/NIA)*100 136 100 3 Area under different crops (ha.) a) Rice  14,71,710 25,831 b) Jowar 83,401 1,021 c) Maize 7,12,981 3,553 d) Red gram 2,51,121 2,262 e) Green gram 95,524 1,775 f) Black gram 31,221 110 g) Bengal gram 80,766 388 h) Groundnut 1,77,914 293 i) Sunflower 17,574 324 j) Chillies 82,649 721 k) Sugarcane 34,775 0 l) Cotton 16,77,492 50,200 m) Horticulture 6,64,326 23,513 4 Agriculture marketing (Nos.) a) Agriculture market committees 180 5 b) Rythu bazars 5 Livestock population a) Cattle 48,80,293 2,11,945 b) Buffaloes 41,60,419 96,960 c) Sheep  1,28,35,761 2,96,133 d) Goats 45,75,695 1,45,376 e) Others 6,20,723 4,859 Total 2,70,72,891 7,55,27316 S.No. Parameters Telangana state Mancherial district 6 Poultry population 8,07,50,833 4,95,788 7 Veterinary facilities a) Poly clinics  8 0 b) Hospitals  100 2 c) Dispensaries  907 27 d) Mobile clinics  37 1 e) Rural livestock units  1,102 15 8 Fisheries a) Fish rearing tanks/reservoirs  24,294 707 Water spread area (ha.) 8,00,269 13,980 b) Fishermen Coop.

The Net Cropped Area (NCA) represents the total area sown with crops and orchards. Area sown  more than once in the same year is counted only once. The NCA is 84,931 ha in the district, while  Gross Cropped Area was 95,568 ha. The GCA represents the total area sown once or more than once  in a particular year, i.e. the area is counted as many times as there are sowings in a year. This total  area is also known as total cropped area or total area sown. The Net Irrigated Area (NIA) is the area  irrigated through any source once in a year for a particular crop is 30,698 ha. It means only 36 per cent  of NCA is irrigated in the district. The gross irrigated area which is the total area under crops, irrigated  once or more than once in a particular year is same as that of NIA in the Mancherial district. Cotton  covers the large area in both state and the district followed by rice and horticulture crops. Maize, red  gram and green gram are grown by a significant farmer, but on smaller parcel of lands. There is a good  scope for crop diversification and intensification by expanding irrigated area in the district as both  cropping intensity and irrigation intensity are low. There are 180 agriculture market committees in the  state with 5 of them in the Mancherial district. Although there are 36 Rythu Bazars (direct farmer to  consumer markets) in the state, but don’t exist in the district. Relatively cattle and goat population in  the district is higher compared to sheep, buffalo and poultry as farmers still use cattle for ploughing and  other agricultural activities and also dairy and goat for meat purpose. Veterinary facilities consist of 2  hospital, 1 mobile clinic and 27 dispensaries in the district. Water spread area in the state accounts for  8,00,269 ha with only 1.7 per cent of that water area spread in the Mancherial district. The district is  mostly dependent on 707 fish rearing tanks/reservoirs for fishing and also for irrigation.17 Kotapally Mandal Kotapally mandal comes under Chennur division of Mancherial district. The distance from mandal  headquarters to district headquarters is 52 km. The mandal consists of 37 revenue villages. A revenue  village is a small administrative region in India, a village with defined borders. One revenue village  may contain many hamlets. Each revenue village is headed by a Village Administrative Officer. The  mandal comprises 34 Gram Panchayats (Gram Panchayat is a basic village-governing institute in Indian  villages. It is a democratic structure at the grass-roots level in India. It is a political institute, acting as  cabinet of the village. The Gram Sabha works as the general body of the Gram Panchayat. Out of 39,428  ha total geographical area, 47.2 per cent is forest area, only 27.1 per cent is cultivable land, but about  25.4 per cent is cultivated. About 70.1 per cent of cultivated area is under rainfed. Cropping intensity  is 116, which indicates that only 16 per cent cultivated area was sown twice (Table 3.3 & Figure 3.5 &  3.6).  Table 3.3: Basic information of Kotapally mandal Basic information about Kotapally mandal  Land use pattern in the mandal  •  Mandal: Kotapally •  Division: Chennur •  District: Mancherial •  Distance from Mancherial: 52 Km •  Number of revenue villages: 37 •  Number of deserted villages: 2 •  Number of gram panchayats: 31 •  Average rainfall: 1,160 mm •  Total geographical area: 39,428 ha •  Area under forest cover: 18,624 ha •  Total cultivable land: 10,671 ha •  Gross sown area: 10,032 ha •  Area under cultivation in rabi: 1,602 ha •  Area under cultivation in kharif: 10,034 ha •  Area under rainfed condition: 7,101 ha •  Area under irrigated condition: 2,931 ha Figure 3.5: Location map of SCSP villages in Kotapally mandal,  Mancherial district, Telangana state Kotapally18 Figure 3.6: Normal cropping pattern in hectares (Kharif and Rabi) in Kotapally mandal Figure 3.7: Detailed cropping pattern in Kotapally mandal The cropping pattern in Kotapally mandal is dominated by cotton and paddy in kharif season and  paddy in rabi season. There is a need for crop diversification and expansion of irrigated area, so that  the cropped area under pulses and millets can be increased with one or two critical irrigations. (Figure  3.7). The similar domination of cotton and paddy was observed in all three study villages (Table 3.4). As  seen from Table 3.4, cotton cropped area is predominant in all villages followed by area under paddy.

Amarender Reddy and Cheruku Saipriya ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  This chapter explains the baseline survey sampling methodology. The study is mostly based on the  primary data. Although CRIDA team initially selected three villages namely Mallampet, Nagampet and  Edagatta from the Kotapally mandal of Mancherial district in Telangana state for interventions under  SCSP plan, later on activities were extended to cover all the remaining 31 villages of the mandal such as  Nakkalpalle, Brahmanpalle, Shankarpur, Shetpalle, Pangadisomaram, Kotapally, Vesonvai, Sarvaipet,  Kondampet, Bopparam, Venchapalle, Supak, Jangaon, Algaon, Pullagaon, Sirsa, Edula Bandam,  Lingannapet, Pinnaram, Parpalle, Yerraipet, Borampalle, Kawarkothapalle, Annaram, Arjungutta,  Rajaram, Rampur, Kollur, Rawalpalle, Dewalwada and Rapanpalle. Three villages namely Chintakunta,  Ayepalle and Adkapalle are with no habitation of population are not covered under the ICAR-CRIDA  SCSP activities. Although, SCSP activities covered 34 villages of the Kotapally mandal, the baseline  survey was carried out in only three selected villages to economize on the cost of conducting the survey  with proper sampling framework, so that the survey represent all the villages in the mandal. A team  of ICAR-CRIDA along with local administration visited all the villages and reviewed the secondary  administrative information available with district officials, three villages namely Mallampet, Nagampet  and Edagatta are selected for baseline survey as they represent all the agro-ecological and socio- economic conditions of the mandal and also having moderate number of households, it means they are  neither too big or too small and represent an average village situation not only in the mandal, but also  in the state and as well as the country. The numbers of households are maximum in Mallampet (254),  followed by Nagampet (241) and the least in Edagatta (131), which are moderate in size and represents  an average village in India. Basic socio-economic profiles of the villages are given in Table 4.1. The  study team followed standard census procedure while collecting data from all the selected three villages  as it covered all the households in the villages (Pedigo and Buntin, 1993; Singh and Masuku, 2014) Among the three villages, Mallampet is the largest village with 1,002 population followed by Nagampet  (966) and Edagatta (512). The total households in Mallampet are 254, Nagampet are 241 and Edagatta  are 131. Sex ratio was highest in Mallampet (1,028), followed by Edagatta (969) and least in Nagampet  (876). Overall and female literacy rate was lowest in Mallampet compared to other two villages. STs  population was less than 5 per cent in all three villages, but SCs population was above 50 per cent in  all three villages with the highest in Nagampet (58.5 per cent) and Mallampet (56.7 per cent). Working  population was highest in Mallampet (57.5 per cent) and lowest in Edagatta (45.1 per cent). Overall,  the data indicates that Mallampet was educationally backward followed by Nagampet and Edagatta.  While, SC and ST population was highest in Nagampet, followed by Mallampet and Edagatta. In all  parameters, Edagatta was more developed compared to other two villages.20 Table 4.1: Demographic profile of the selected villages Parameter Mallampet Nagampet Edagatta Total population 1,002 966 512 Total number of houses 254 241 131 Sex ratio 1,028 876 969 Total literacy rate (%) 45.5 % (456) 58.0 % (560) 56.6 % (290) Female literacy rate (%) 17.4 % (174) 23.3 % (225) 23.8 % (122) Scheduled tribes population (%) 2.6 % (26) 4.7 % (45) 0.2 % (1) Scheduled caste population (%) 56.7 % (568) 58.5 % (565) 49.8 % (255) Working population (%) 57.5 % 56.1 % 45.1 % Child (0-6) population, 2011 111 61 51 Sex ratio (among 0-6 years  population), 2011 820 488 1125 The baseline survey was carried out by following census method. That is each and every household was  surveyed by using pre-tested questionnaire. The questionnaire was canvassed a total of 504 households  for the study. From Mallampet village 156 households, from Nagampet village 243 households and from  Edagatta 105 households (Figure 4.1). The total household members in the villages are different from  census 2011, as many households are migrated out especially from Mallampet. All the data collected  was post-classified based on social groups, land holding groups and area groups (village). Figure 4.1: Sampling details of selected villages References Pedigo, L.

Rejani ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The SC-Sub plan programme is implemented in three adopted villages of Kotapally mandal of  Mancherial district in Telangana state viz., Edagatta, Mallampet and Nagampet from year 2018-19.  This chapter illustrates the socio-economic profile of the households in base line year 2018-19. The  socioeconomic profile of the villages is assessed by the following methods: 1.  Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools  2.  Focus Group Discussions (FGD) 3.  Primary Survey. 1. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA): Recently renamed as Participatory Learning for Action  (PLA), is a methodological approach that is used to enable farmers to analyse their own situation and to  develop a common perspective on natural resource management and agriculture at village level. PRA is  an assessment and learning process that empowers farmers to create the information base they need for  participatory planning and action. Outsiders contribute facilitation skills and external information and  opinions. Many different tools have been developed for use in PRA. There are four main classes: tools  used in group and team dynamics; tools for sampling; options for interviews and dialogue; and options  for visualization and preparing diagrams. It is a way of learning from and with community members  to investigate, analyze and evaluate constraints and opportunities, need assessment and priorities in  the field of agriculture and other social and economic development programmes addressed to village  developed. In PRA, seasonal analysis to assess the seasonal trends relating to farming and allied fields and problem  identification tools has been used in the present study.  a) Seasonal analysis: This is one of the PRA tools that indicates the specific activities that occur during  the different months relating to farming and allied fields. It helps to know about labour requirement,  migration, disease and pest incidence, natural calamities that occur and other important relevant events  affecting farming activities. South West monsoon (June to September) is the major source of rain for kharif crops in the study  villages (Figure 5.1). In the month of May, land preparation activity takes place. In June, sowing of  paddy seedlings in nursery along with sowing of cotton commences. In July, the various activities  scheduled are paddy transplanting; fertilizer application to cotton; Foot and Mouth disease, Hemorrhagic  Septicemia and Black quarter disease incidence in cattle. In August, weeding and pest appearance like  stem borer in paddy; pesticide and fertilizer application in cotton at 15 day’s time interval twice. In  September, pesticide and fertilizer application in cotton at 15  day’s time interval take place twice. In  October, paddy harvesting and cotton picking commences and there will be high demand for labour. The  peak demand for labour is from June to November, after November, up to May there is no much demand22 for labour except public works like The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,  2005 (MGNREGA). Most of the men are engaged in ploughing, land preparation, spraying of pesticides,  while women are engaged in transplanting of paddy, weeding in both paddy and cotton and picking of  cotton. Sowing operations are done by both male and female.  Activity Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May. Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec.

Accordingly, ten key informants among farmers in each village were  selected for recording their responses. The maximum number of key informants pointing to a particular  problem was identified as number one ranked problem; the second maximum number of  key informants  pointing to a problem as second ranked problem etc., was the procedure followed in ranking problems.  The problems are listed below: i.  Low incomes and yields ii.  Water scarcity iii.  Lack of knowledge on intercrops, crop rotation iv.  Low productivity of horticultural crops v.  Low productivity of kitchen garden  vi.  Low awareness on soil and water conservation activities vii.  Pest problems in maize viii.  Lack of mechanization in crops ix.  Unstable market prices x.  Problem of wild boar xi.  Low awareness on alternate sources of women employment The problem of low yields and incomes is analysed and decomposed in to causes and sub-causes as  shown in Figure 5.2.23 Figure 5.2: Fishbone diagram of problem diagnosis 2. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted to elicit qualitative data from farmers.  Focus Group Discussions were organized among farmers, agricultural labourer, women groups, youth  to identify problems and solutions in a participatory approach. The main problems identified are   (i) Low crop yields; (ii) Low income; (iii) Youth unemployment; (iv) Market price fluctuation;   (v) Lack of tarpaulins for drying grains between harvest and marketing; (vi) Lack of appropriate farm  machinery for pumpsets, sprayers, improved cultivators; (vii) Lack of skills to engage in alternative  income sources like livestock rearing and off-farm and non-farm activities; (viii) Improved varieties of  crops and livestock breeds, etc. (Figure 5.3).  Figure 5.3: Farmer’s problems and average score (1-10:10 highest) 3. Primary survey was conducted through interview method to elicit quantitative data from farmers  with the help of questionnaire.24 A) Social groups (Caste) The percentage distribution of household samples based on the socio-economic status is illustrated in  Chart 1-4. It can be observed from the collected 504 samples that there is a prominence of Scheduled  Caste (SC) households’ (74 per cent) which is followed by Other Backward Caste (OBC) (20 per cent)  and Scheduled Tribe (ST) (6 per cent) (Figure 5.4 & Table 5.1). A majority of the households in each  village are from the scheduled caste followed by backward caste and then the scheduled tribes. There  is no household belongs to Forward Caste (FC/OC), except Mallampet where only one household is  there. Predominance of SC households in these villages are also associated with low level of access to  public infrastructure like roads, schools and hospitals due to historical neglect in investments in public  infrastructure. Table 5.1: Distribution of household’s by socio-economic groups Village SC ST OBC FC/OC  Total Edagatta 65 11 29 105 Mallampet 135 6 14 1 156 Nagampet 174 12 57 243 Total 374 29 100 1 504 Figure 5.4: Percentage distribution of household’s by caste group under each village25 B) Land holdings Historically, land is the only source of income generation in these types of remote villages due to lack of  alternative sources of income. Size distribution of land holdings is one of the most important indicators  of measuring the income opportunities and economic power structure and interrelations between and  among the households, type of technological adoption, profitability and employment within the villages.  Distribution of households in the three villages based on landholding size class is depicted in the Table  5.2. It provides a distinct picture of the high proportion of marginal landholdings (more than 50 per  cent with less than 1 ha) akin to the traits of Indian agriculture landholding size. Marginal and small  farmers (1-2 ha) together are contributing to about 80 per cent of farmers of sample households in all  the three villages. Less than 2 per cent of the landholdings are large size holders with more than 10 ha  in the sample. Table 5.2: Distribution of household’s by land holding class by village Village Marginal Small Medium Large Total Edagatta 63 (60.0 %) 30 (28.6 %) 11 (10.5 %) 1 (1.0 %) 105 (100 %) Mallampet 77 (49.4 %) 48 (30.8 %) 28 (17.9 %) 3 (1.9 %) 156 (100 %) Nagampet 116 (47.7 %) 78 (32.1 %) 46 (18.9 %) 3 (1.2 %) 243 (100 %) Total 256 (50.8 %) 156 (31.0 %) 85 (16.9 %) 7 (1.4 %) 504 (100 %) The land size classification of sample households among the socioeconomic groups is illustrated in  Table 5.3. Noticeably across all the socioeconomic groups the marginal lands stand out in percentage  terms over the small, medium and large size land holdings in all the sample villages. The share of  marginal landholders was 49 per cent among SCs, 83 per cent among STs, 47 per cent among OBCs and  nil among OC (Other/Forward caste) households. The share of large landholders among SCs is one per  cent, while among STs 10 per cent and among OBCs two per cent. It shows that among SCs, majority  of households belong to small and marginal farmers category, with only one per cent belonging to large  farmers category, while among STs and OBCs share of large farmers are little better.  Table 5.3: Distribution of household’s by land holding class by social group by village Village SC ST OBC FC/OC Marginal Small Medium Large Total Marginal Small Medium Total Marginal Small Medium Large Total  Medium Total  Edagatta 62 28 11 0 100 91 9 0 100 45 38 14 3 100 0 0 Mallampet 47 33 17 2 100 100 0 0 100 50 21 29 0 100 100 100 Nagampet 47 32 20 1 100 67 8 25 100 47 37 14 2 100 0 0 Total 49 32 17 1 100 83 7 10 100 47 35 16 2 100 100 10026 C) Farm size of the household’s The average farm size of the households by social group is shown in Figure 5.5. In all the three villages,  the average farm size is less than 3 acre; however, farm size was slightly higher among STs followed by  SCs and OBCs. While for FCs it was 8 acres, but only one household belongs to this caste. Average farm  size was less than 3 acres in all three villages, but there is slight variation, Nagampet and Mallampet  average farm size was 2.9 acres, while it was only 2.4 acres in Edagatta. In terms of size of the land  holdings (Figure 5.6), all the three villages have nearly similar number of marginal, small, medium and  large farms. Marginal farmers with average farm size of less than one acre constitute 50 per cent of the  farmers, the average size of small farmers is just 3 acres, and their share in the sample farmers is about  30 per cent. Medium farmers constitute about 15 per cent with average farm size of 6.3 acres. While  large farmers share is just 5 per cent but the average size of the farms is 11.3 acres. The small farm size,  in addition to the low level of adoption of new technologies and no alternative sources of income are the  main constraints to come out of poverty for most of the households in the study villages.  Figure 5.5: Average farm size (in acre) by social group and village Figure 5.6: Average farm size (in acre) by land size category by village27 D) Household composition and education Educational level and literacy rates enhance the human power in households in multifaceted ways.  It generally increases employment and income opportunities within and outside the village, help in  adoption of new agricultural technology, getting benefits from different government schemes and  also help in overall participation of households in various socio-economic programmes in the village.  Average household size (number of family members in the family) getting reduced over the years, with  joint families replaced by nuclear families and also with the adoption of family planning. The average  household size of the study area is 2.8 which is much lower than the district average (3.8) and state  average (4). On average, male population is higher than female population in the villages, which may  be true, but sometimes may be due to under reporting of number of women due to the existing local  socio-economic conditions. However, in Edagatta, female population was higher than male population,  might be due to the outmigration of males to work in nearby towns and urban centres. The higher level  of outmigration in the village may be attributed to nearness to the road network which connected to  Chennur and farther to district headquarters Mancherial and Hyderabad. The average years of schooling  is around 6 years pointing towards the very low level of education among the people. The literacy status  of the head of the household is one of important attribute which capture the household’s socio-economic  status and also ability of the household to adopt new technology. The average literacy rate of the head  of the household was 27.2 per cent in the study area which is much lower than the district average of  75.7 per cent. The literacy rate was the highest in Edagatta (43.8 per cent) and lowest in Nagampet  (17.3 per cent). The higher level of literacy in Edagatta is also may be one of the reasons for higher  migration levels in the village (Table 5.3). The lower literacy rate in the study area may be attributed to  higher share of SC and ST in the villages and also remoteness of the villages. There is a vast difference  in literacy rate among land size classes and social groups. People with large landholding have highest  average years of schooling as well as highest percentage of literate heads in the households among all  the other landholding class. It is also to be noted that, large farmers are having bigger family size and  also with higher female population compared to other land size classes. The higher female population  among large land size class may indicate less discrimination against women mainly due to their higher  educational levels and higher literacy rates. Average family size among the SCs and STs are 2.8 and 2.6,  which indicates dominance of the nuclear families in the village coupled with out-migration of many  family members either due to education or for employment purpose (Table 5.4 & 5.5). During the focus  group interactions, many households reported that the aged parents are willing to live separately from  their children’s families to avoid conflicts among the members and also because of income received  from old-age pensions. There is no much difference among SCs, STs and OBCs in terms of education,  but only FC families are far better in both average years of schooling and also literacy rate of the head  of the family.

Across the sample villages the average family size is 3  out of which about 2 family members are involved in farming on an average and the same trend is also  observed across all the socioeconomic groups except for FCs where family size and family members  involved in the farming are same (Table 5.6 & Figure 5.7). The data indicates that, irrespective of  their age, all the household’s members are more or less engaged in agricultural activities, unless and  otherwise they are very old and not able to work. Even those old-aged people also participating in  some economic activities within their household premises, like involved in backyard poultry, work in  backyard gardening by growing vegetable crops, cleaning of grain and drying of grain, etc. (Figure 5.8,  5.9, 5.11).

The past experience shows that about 5-6 years of  farming experience is sufficient for almost all agricultural operations in more efficient way, more  experience also indicates that perpetuation in old agricultural practices, not inclined for change to new  and improved methods of agriculture. Most of the sample households have been involved in agriculture  for about 19 years (Figure 5.10), which indicates experience is not a constraint for adopting good  agricultural practices. On the other hand, a farmer with more than 15 years of experience habitual to do  only old agricultural practices, motivating him to adopt new and improved agricultural practices require  more efforts from the extension agencies and scientists. SC farmers on an average have about 20 years  of experience, while lowest is among STs with only 14 years of experience. Although farmers are still  using old type of ploughs, bullock carts, sickles (single-handed agricultural tool designed with variously  curved blades and typically used for harvesting) etc., they are also adopting new technology especially  fertilizers, pesticides, crop varieties (especially cotton), if they found useful and simple to use.  Most of the farmers own only drylands with minimal investments in agriculture. The average investment  per household was just Rs. 21,218/acre (Figure 5.10). Investment by SC households is little less than  all other households. However, there is no significant difference across the social groups in terms of  investment per acre. There is significant difference in investment per acre and also years of experience  in farming across land size class. The marginal farms are being tilled for 18 years with an average  investment of Rs. 20,800 with at least one family member of the sample households and a minimum of  two persons are engaged on small and medium farms with an average investment of Rs. 21,400. Whereas,  the large farmers are having farming experience of 29 years, with no more than 3 people involved, with  average investment per acre Rs. 24,200, which is significantly higher than that of marginal, small and  medium farmers (Figure 5.12). It indicates that the large farmers are taking advantage of new technology  mostly tractor drawn farm implements like improved plough, cultivator, seed cum fertilizer drill and31 harrow etc., and investing a significant amount to overcome the shortage of labour and increased wage  rates. Further, paddy crop operations like sowing, transplanting, weeding and harvesting are seasonal,  most of the operations are fully mechanized on large farms, but on marginal and small farms, still  farmers are doing most of the operations through manual labour, mostly by own-labour or many time  exchange of labour among neighboring farmers. The local wage rates are steeply increased after the  implementation of The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA:  100 day’s guaranteed public work for each household at minimum wage rates) especially for women.  Although, large farmers mechanized most of the paddy operations, still they are depending upon wage  labour for cotton cultivation mainly for weeding and picking. Especially during the paddy transplanting,  weeding and cotton weeding and picking there was huge demand for women wage labour and farmers  have to give money intime and also provide other amenities like arranging food, transport etc., during  the peak demand for labour. Male labourer are mostly engaged in land preparation, ploughing, inter- cultivation through bullocks, transport of grain, operation of tractor drawn implements like cultivators,  operation of sprayers and dusters, etc.  Figure 5.11: Women taking care of small ruminants Figure 5.12: Average number of family members involved in farming and  investment (Rs.) and number of years in farming by land class32 F) Investment capabilities of the households The average investment in agriculture on acre basis, Figure 5.13, is observed to be made highest by  the Scheduled Tribe farmers in the Edagatta village (Rs. 30,000) and the lowest by the FC farmers  in Mallampet village (Rs. 15,000). In total sample only one FC household is there, that too, they are  actively engaged in non-farm activities. This is half of what a Scheduled tribe farmer of Edagatta  village farmer pays. This shows that, slowly, farmers who have capabilities in terms of social contacts,  education are slowly investing out of agriculture and trying to settling down in non-agricultural activities  either they are petty business or engaged as contractors in construction or any other works related to  nearby town. Further, the average agriculture investment is higher in Edagatta village (Rs. 29,000) than  the Mallampet (Rs. 19,600) and Nagampet (Rs. 18,800) villages distinguishably. In Nagampet village  the average investment difference over the socioeconomic groups is seen to be little. One of the main  contributing factor of higher investments in Edagatta is it is well-connected through road networks  and easily accessible with all urban amenities. Although, there was significant difference among three  villages in terms of investment per acre, that difference don’t exists within the village among different  land size class farmers (Figure 5.14). That is both the large and marginal farmers in Edagatta invested  Rs 30,000 and 29,000, respectively, while large and marginal farmers in Nagampet invested Rs. 22,000  and 18,000 per acre, respectively. The average investment in agriculture for large farms is Rs. 24,000,  while among marginal, small and medium farms it is Rs. 21,000. Figure 5.13: Average investment in agriculture per acre by social group (Rs. 1,000/acre) Figure 5.14: Average investment in agriculture per acre by land class (Rs. 1,000/ acre)33 The above data illustrates that the farmers in these villages are not only deprived of less operational  holdings but are also economically backward and are unable to invest enough in agriculture and land  development to reap higher returns (as seen from the past studies of Gupta, 2005; Reddy et al., 2014A;  Reddy et al., 2014; Pattnaik et al., 2018; Jha et al., 2018). The condition is worst in Nagampet village and  in micro level, the FC farmers marginal farmers population are suffering badly, although for different  reasons. Being remote is working against Nagampet farmers as they are not well-connected to nearest  town and their other sources of income are low, hence they are not able to invest as that of Edagatta,  which is closely linked with nearest town. Except, large farmers all other category farmers are having  too small land parcels for cultivation, which is not producing enough returns to invest to improve crop  yields. Their incomes are hardly sufficient for their consumption needs.  However, the recent government Direct Money Transfer Schemes such as PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri  Kisan Samman Nidhi is an initiative by the government of India in which all farmers will get up to   Rs. 6,000 per year as minimum income support) and Rythu Bandhu (Rythu Bandhu scheme also Farmer’s  Investment Support Scheme is a welfare program to support farmer’s investment for two crops a year  by the Government of Telangana. The government is providing Rs. 58.33 lakh farmers Rs. 5,000 per  acre per season to support the farm investment, twice a year, for rabi and kharif seasons) are playing an  important role to increase investments in farming by the farmers. Although crop insurance scheme is  implemented in the villages, very few are benefited.  References Gupta, D. (2005). Whither the Indian village?: Culture and agriculture in ‘rural’India.

Amarender Reddy and D. S. Ramanjul Reddy ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  In this chapter, household’s employment and income status, sources of income along with the ownership  of household durable consumer goods, assets across socio-economic groups and land size class are  discussed. Historically, the villages predominantly habituated by the SC households are generally poor.  The employment and income opportunities are not diversified, they mostly depend on agriculture,  especially in villages where droughts are recurring phenomenon and agriculture is rainfed (Reddy and  Kumar, 2006; Reddy, 2015; Blakeslee, 2020; ). The ownership of various household items (durable  consumer goods) like having TV, refrigerator, car/bike, etc., will give clear indication of the living  standards of the households, which can be comparable both temporally and geographically (Dreze and  Srinivasan, 1997; Saccani et al., 2017; Mahapatro et al., 2017). Many households also have permanent  assets in terms of agricultural land and household dwellings and some have gold jewellery and bank  savings accounts or LIC premium certificates.  A) Source of income The major source of income in all the three villages for the sample households is agriculture (61.1 per  cent), which is followed by wages from Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,  (MGNREGA) (16.8 per cent), off-farm income (5.0 per cent) and non-farm income (4.5 per cent).  The livestock contributes to only 3 per cent of total income (Figure 6.1). Other income is 8.4 per cent,  which might have included government supported direct money transfer schemes like schemes like old- age pension, Rythu Bandhu, PM-KISAN, etc. It is noted that migration is also an option for marginal  and small land holders, but there is no migration evident among the large farmers from the sample  households. Figure 6.1: Sources of income of households by land size class35 Among marginal farmers, because of the low agricultural employment and income, especially during  the post-rainy and summer season, MGNREGA became a considerable source of income, contributing  about 22.7 per cent of total income. Whereas, for large farmers its share is just 6.2 per cent of their  total earning, while they earn a major chunk (about 86 per cent) from agriculture. Livestock rearing is  more prevalent in medium size farmers with 5 per cent of their income, while its contribution is almost  negligible among large farmers. Income and employment diversification among marginal farmers are  higher especially towards public works under MGNRGA, off-farm and non-farm activities. Income  diversification is also picking up even among small and medium farmer’s (Table 6.1 and Figure 6.2).  Table 6.1: Household income per annum from all sources by farm size category Land size  class Percentage of total annual income  Average  household  income (Rs.) Crops Livestock Off farm  employment Non-farm  employment Migration MGNREGA Others Marginal 48.3 2.9 6.5 5.3 1.6 22.7 12.7 36,773  (100) Small 65.1 1.8 4.6 4.8 0.2 16.7 6.8 55,946  (100) Medium 68.5 5 5.8 3.5 0 11.3 5.9 87,624  (100) Large 86.8 0 4.1 2.1 0 6.2 0.8 1,72,857  (100) Total 61.1 3 5.6 4.5 0.6 16.8 8.4 53,174  (100) Figure 6.2: Sheep rearing in the village36 Average income of STs was the lowest, followed by OBC, SC and highest among FCs (Figure 6.3).  However, income gap among social groups is less than the gap between marginal and large land-class. It  indicates that, the social group as an indicator of economic status is losing relevance, while landholding  size playing a major role in higher incomes.  Figure 6.3: Sources of income by social group Among all social groups, ST households received the lowest share of income from agriculture (49.8 per  cent of total income), which was followed by SCs (60.4 per cent of total income) as against the 71.4 per  cent for FC households. Also, income from the livestock rearing is higher in the other caste group at 7.1  per cent and is the lowest for scheduled tribe at 2.8 per cent. Although agriculture is main source of income (71 per cent) for only FC/OC household present in the  sample, a good chunk of income is also coming from non-farm employment, which is highest among the  all the groups (21.4 per cent of total income). While non-farm incomes not crossed even 5 per cent for  all other social groups with lowest for the backward class at 2.8 per cent and for scheduled castes at 4.8  per cent. The large chunk from non-farm income for FC household, may be due to their higher level of  education and also assets and capabilities to start and build non-farm income sources like petty business  or engagement in contracts, etc. Whereas, the SCs, STs and OBCs lack those networks, capabilities like  initial human and physical capital to take advantage of non-farm employment. Almost 20 per cent of  the earnings of STs and SCs are received from MGNREGA. Off farm income is significant among STs  (off-farm income encompasses all agriculture-related activities that occur beyond the farm. Examples  of off-farm income and enterprise include processing, packaging, storage, transportation distribution,  and retail sale). Apart from STs and SCs, MGNREGA contributes to the income of OBCs significantly  at 14.3 per cent. However, involvement of FCs in MGNREGA activities is limited (Table 6.2). Table 6.2: Household income per annum from all sources by social group Social  group  Percentage of total annual income Average  household  income (Rs.)

After  agriculture as the main source of income is public works under MGNREGA in all the three villages. In  Edagatta village, 32.2 per cent of income of the residents and 15 per cent in Mallampet and Nagampet  is through MGNREGA. Among all the villages, Edagatta is having very low average income per  household, whereas Mallampet and Nagampet are little better off. The main reason for low incomes in  Edagatta village is low-income diversification; there is almost no income from livestock, off-farm and  non-farm employment and also migration. Majority of the households in the village are just depending  on crop production, in the off-season like summer and post-rainy seasons they are engaged in public  works of MGNREGA. Although, average income of households in Mallampet village was highest, the  share coming from agriculture is only 53.2 per cent. There is significant income from off-farm and  non-farm employment (Figure 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and Table 6.3). Hence, in Mallampet, there is a need for  increasing agricultural incomes along with livestock incomes. In Nagampet income sources are more  diversified than other two villages.  Figure 6.4: Average income by villages Table 6.3: Household income per annum from all sources by village Village  Percentage of total annual income Average  household  income (Rs.)

Typically 25 per cent of the households in Edagatta, Mallampet and Nagampet villages are having either  car/bike (mostly two wheelers) and the smart mobile phone is less popular among the population as it is  used by only 40 per cent of the households. Despite 95 per cent or more households having electricity  facility, only 10.7 per cent of the households have a refrigerator whereas television is being viewed by  exceedingly over half the households of the three villages and a maximum in Mallampet at 74 per cent.  About 70 per cent of the households have ordinary phones, in which most of the communication is  from WhatsApp group messages, video stream relating to agricultural technology cannot be accessible.  Overall, there is no significant difference between the villages in ownership of household durables, still  a slightly lower use in Edagatta and more use in Mallampet and Nagampet were observed.  Figure 6.6: Traditional multipurpose shelter for livestock39 Figure 6.7: General living standards of households  (Percentage of households having different amenities) by village Figure 6.8: General living standards of households  (Percentage of households having different amenities) by socio-economic groups From the Figure 6.8, it is clear that accessibility to electricity reached more than 90 per cent in all social  groups, but still 10 per cent of STs 7 per cent of OBCs and 3 per cent of SCs are not yet accessing the  electricity, which is a basic necessity in modern life. In most of the goods, TV, smart phone, two-wheeler  and also in case of refrigerator ST households are worse off than even SC households. In the sample  villages, only one household belongs to FC and they have access to all the modern household durable  items. All though, accessibility to electricity and ordinary mobile phone are more or less uniform across  social group and also land class (Figure 6.8 and 6.9), there is significant difference in accessing the  TV, smart mobile, two-wheeler and refrigerator, this difference is much higher among land class group  (between large and marginal farmers), then between social groups (between ST and FC households).  Noticing through the land holding class and social group, with the existing adequate electricity facilities,  refrigerator is not a popular durable good when compared to news/entertainment/communication goods  such as television/mobile phone.40 Figure 6.9: General living standards of households  (Percentage of households having different amenities) by land size class Figure 6.10: Mode of transport into the village Figure 6.11: Participatory Rural Appraisal in the study village41 Overall, the income levels (the annual income of Rs. 53,174 translating in to monthly income of Rs.  4,431) are very low in the study villages compared to the income levels (Rs.10,218 per month) of the  recent nationally representative sample from the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) almost  of the same period of 2018-19. The low incomes compounded with low level of social networks being  dominated by SC and ST households reduce their capabilities to earn higher income. Even though most  of the households having access to electricity, they don’t have other modern amenities like TV/smart  phone, which indicates their lower living standards which needs to be increased through enhancing  incomes from not only agriculture but also from livestock, off-farm and non-farm activities (Figure  6.10 and 6.11).

Meghana  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The provision of public goods by the government is one of the best strategies of poverty alleviation  (Chhibber et al., 2004; Benerjee and Somanathan, 2007; Roy 2021).The access to basic amenities  like electricity, gas connection for cooking, sanitation, potable water for drinking, ration shop to get  subsidized food under Public Distribution System (PDS), school, nearest bus stand for accessing  public transport, market for selling the agricultural produce and purchase of inputs and other necessary  household items, Primary Health Centre (hospital) to consult doctor and bank for financial services  like saving etc., are indicators of getting access to public goods and also indicates efficiency of local  government in provision of public goods to the citizens (Reddy et al., 2016; Ansary and Da, 2018 ).  This chapter examined the access to public amenities and also public goods by the households in the  SC-Sub plan villages.  A) Access to basic and essential amenities The basic amenities such as drinking water, electricity, sanitation, housing, drainage and others are very  crucial for a secure, dignified and healthy human life. The existing status and access to such amenities  reflects standard of living, and poverty levels, especially in\\xa0rural\\xa0areas. In all the villages, access to  electricity and cooking gas connection is almost saturated, except a few gaps, like still 7 per cent  households in Mallampet don’t have access to electricity, while about 10 per cent don’t have access to  gas connection. Access to sanitation and tap water is uneven among the villages, mostly not reached  to the poorest of the poor like disabled, old-aged and households with no earning member. Among the  three villages, Nagampet village is badly placed in terms of basic both sanitation and potable water. In Edagatta village, more than 90 per cent of the households have access to all the amenities mainly  its proximity to Kotapally mandal headquarters, whereas, about 40 per cent households in Mallampet  village do not have access to potable water. In Nagampet village, only 36 per cent households have  access to potable water and about 54 per cent have sanitation facility (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Percentage of households having essential amenities by village43 Figure 7.2: Percentage of households having essential amenities by social group But among the social groups, except forward caste households, access to sanitation and potable water is  poor, it is especially serious in case of potable water. Among, SC, ST and BC households, ST households  are slightly better placed with regard to potable water as the community firmly represented their issues  through their elected representatives and secured government funded potable pipeline connections  under Mission Bhagiratha (Figure 7.2). Figure 7.3: Percentage of households having essential amenities by land size class Again, irrespective of the land-holding size, access to potable water is a major problem. Even among  large farmers who are in general better access to all these amenities, only 86 per cent having sanitation  facilities in their house, the remaining 14 per cent households not having access to sanitation, which  needs to be bridged (Figure 7.3) and access among marginal farmers is just 69 per cent. One positive  aspect is, across social as well as landholding groups, electricity and gas connection amenities are  available to almost all the households. So, overall it is clear that the study area is deprived of the  most important essential amenities like tap water and also sanitation which are an indication of overall44 backwardness, this is in spite of running of special programmes like Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)/ Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) for sanitation improvement and also state government programmes  like Mission Bhagiratha, which aimed at providing drinking water to each household in the villages  (Dandabathula et al., 2019; Srinivasan and Joy, 2019). During the focus group discussions, villagers  mentioned that the work is under progress and will be completed within one or two years mostly funded  by the government. B) Access to other public amenities Access and nearness to public amenities like ration shop, school, bus stand, market, hospital and bank  make life easy for rural dwellers saves time for daily commuting to avail facilities for these daily  essentials (Figure 7.4). Ration shop and school are within 1-2 km from their house for all the sample  households in three villages. Bus stand also less than 2 km, except in Edagatta village. While, distance  to market, hospital and bank is higher at about 3-6 km from home. (Figure 7.5 to 7.7). Mallampet village  has all the service facilities within 3.5 km, whereas, for Edagatta and Nagampet villages the Hospital  and Bank are far-off (more than 5 km away from the village). Figure 7.4: Nearest public school Figure 7.5: Average distance to access the amenities (km) by village45 Figure 7.6: Average distance to access the amenities (km) from house by social group Figure 7.7: Average distance to access the amenities (km) by land size class Figure 7.6 and 7.7 shows that bus stand, school, and ration shop are within 2 km of reach for all social  groups as well as the land holding groups. But the hospital, market and bank are distantly placed and  people need to travel to access these facilities. But it is apparently noted that the households of FC  community have a very easy access to all the facilities as these are quite nearer to them in comparison  to the other social groups. This scenario also corresponds to the better access in terms of nearness to  basic amenities for large farmers compared to marginal, small and medium farmers. But disparities in  accessing and nearness to basic amenities are larger among social groups than on the basis of land class  size. C) Access of various government schemes The villagers are mostly poor when compared to urban areas not only in the study area, but also across  India. The governments (central, state and local governments) have planned and running various  development schemes since independence with varied success rates. In line with this, there are various  ongoing government schemes in the study area among which Bank account (JanDhan: Pradhan Mantri  Jan Dhan Yojana is a financial inclusion programme of the Government of India open to Indian citizens,  that aims to expand affordable access to financial services such as bank accounts, remittances, credit,46 insurance and pensions) (Figure 7.8), ration card (ration cards offer identification as well entitle the  holder to a ration of food, fuel, or other goods issued by the Government of India), MGNREGA card  (The Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act 2005), is an Indian labour law and social security  measure that aims to guarantee the ‘right to work’. This act was passed in 23 August 2005, which  guarantees 100 days of employment in their own locality on demand), Aarogyasri card (Aarogyasri  Scheme is a unique Community Health Insurance Scheme being implemented in State. The scheme  provides financial protection to families living below poverty line upto Rs. 2 lakhs in a year for the  treatment of serious ailments requiring hospitalization and surgery), membership in SHG (A SHG is  a community-based group with 10-25 members. Members are usually women from similar social and  economic backgrounds; all voluntarily coming together to save small sums of money, on a regular basis  and use saved money for productive purpose like dairy. Rythu Bandhu scheme is also helping farmers  to meet their cash expenses in agriculture like purchase of seed and fertilizers. Under the scheme,  Telangana government is directly transferring cash to Rs. 58.33 lakh farmer’s bank accounts at the  rate of Rs. 5,000 per acre per season for both rabi and kharif seasons at the beginning of crop season.  Another important schemes is the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, which is a Government of India  scheme which provides farmers with timely access to credit. The KCC scheme was launched in year  1998 with the aim of providing short-term formal credit to farmers and was created by NABARD  (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development). The KCC scheme was introduced to ensure  that the credit requirements for farmers in the agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sector are  met. This was done by helping them avail short-term loans and provide them with a credit limit to  purchase equipment and for their other expenses as well. Moreover, with the help of KCC, farmers are  exempted from the high interest rates of the regular loans offered by banks as the interest rate for KCC  starts as low as 2 per cent and averages at 4 per cent. Under this scheme, farmers can repay their loans  depending on the harvesting period of their crop for which the loan was given. some other welfare  schemes primarily targeted to weaker sections are old-aged, widowed are Aasara pension schemes. It  is a welfare scheme of pensions to old people, widows, Goud community, elephantiasis patients, AIDS  afflicted people, physically disabled and beedi workers. Each person is getting Rs.1,000 per month, now  it is revised to Rs. 2,000 per month, All these schemes are important and having significant popularity  among the villagers. There are two aspects to the actual benefits received from the schemes. One is  having eligibility and essential eligibility card and another is whether the households are really getting  the benefits by using the eligibility. Figure 7.8: Nearest Bank (Regional Rural bank)47 Figure 7.9: Percentage of households having different eligibility cards and  use of different government schemes Figure 7.9 presents scheme wise beneficiary households in the sample villages. Overall, many  households are actually benefited from bank account under Jan Dhan Yojana, ration card, MGNREGA  works, Rythu Bandhu. While, benefits from getting Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) from government  departments, aarogyasri, Aasara pensions are less. However, popularity of Aarogyasri and SHGs are on  par with more popular schemes like ration card and MGNREGA.  Figure 7.10: Scheme wise beneficiaries by social group Figure 7.10 and 7.11 depicts benefits and uses for households from various government scheme by  social group and land holding class. The Figures shows that irrespective of the social group and land  holding groups over 90 per cent of the sample households possess ration cards and bank accounts.  However, utilization of these are little bit less. Also, there is a good coverage of MGNREGA card and  Aarogyasri cards; however utilization of former is more than the later. Aasara pensions are also popular  among the old-aged, but still some are not able to get due to lack of proper age certificate or residence  certificate. And it is very surprising to see that most of the people except large land holders and FC48 households are unable to get the access to the information from various departments through SMS,  which is very important to create awareness and intimating the households about various developmental  information. The government officials are recently using WhatsApp messages for sending messages,  that too not all households, as officials are having contact numbers of only progressive farmers.  Overall, there is almost universal access to some public amenities like electricity, ration card, MGNREGA  works, and bank accounts, however, they are not all using and getting benefits from them. Although  many farmers have SHC cards and Aarogyasri cards, their utilization is less. While the SMS sent to  citizens regarding government schemes are less and their utilization for decision making is still lower,  hence there is a need for increasing awareness of importance of SMS in dissemination of information.

Srinivas, Ashish Dhimate and Shailesh Borkar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Use of farm machinery and equipment play a greater role in agricultural incomes. Farm equipment and  machinery play a vital role in enhancing agricultural productivity and improving income. Therefore, lack  of access to agricultural equipment can be a limiting factor for the agricultural development of the farm  households. Use of appropriate farm machinery will save time and increase labour productivity and also  reduces drudgery. This will allow men and women to have more time for doing other ancillary works  (Ball et al., 1997; Rada and Fugie, 2019). In India farm mechanization picked up steeply since last two  decades in all activities like land preparation, inter-cultivation, weeding, harvesting and threshing. But  the adoption levels are uneven with higher mechanization in some crops like wheat, chickpea, cotton,  etc. (Singh, 2005; Mehta et al., 2019 ). In study villages, still modern farm machinery and farm implements are not popular. They are mostly  using desi plough (iron/wood) for land preparation, bullock cart for transport, manual sprayers and  dusters and blade hoe for weeding, etc. A significant number of farmers are using tractors for land  preparation mainly on hired basis. About 10 per cent of the households are having power sprayers. Less  than 2 per cent of the households have sprinkler set or drip irrigation, pumpset, fertilizer cum seed drill,  modern plough, BBF planter, blade harrow, chaff cutter, etc. The below Figure indicate that, in terms  of farm machinery the villages are backward (Figure 8.1). Our focus group discussions indicate that,  there is a need for pumpsets, power sprayers and dusters, modern ploughs, sprinklers and dusters with  the increased acreage under cotton.  Figure 8.1: Percentage of farmers using different types of farm machinery50 Use of farm machinery and equipment in three villages and among varied classes of social groups  and land size groups in the sample villages are presented in Tables 8.1 to 8.3 and Figures 8.2 to 8.4  respectively. Among the three villages, farm mechanization is more or less same, but little more in  Edagatta compared to other two villages. In Edagatta, tractorization and use of power sprayers and  sprinkler sets was higher, where as in Nagampet and Mallampet many are still using bullock carts and  desi plough.

In general, farm  mechanization and ownership of different modern farm implements increased from marginal farmers to  large farmers. Except the large farmers, there is a negligible use of power tiller and tractor. However, the  bullock cart is being used not only by many of the marginal farmers but also most of the small, medium  and large farmers. Even though with the change in times, ownership of tractors increased, the use of  bullock carts is not decreased in the villages, may be due to the ready availability of draft animals in  the village.

Edagatta  village farmers are adopting more modern farm machinery due to their nearness to town and more  accessibility and exposure to outer world. Still majority are using desi plough, bullock cart, and manual  sprayers. Among modern farm machinery, tractor is more popular across all social groups and also land  categories, as hiring of tractor is scale neutral.

Srinivas ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State Historically, soils play very important role in formation of human civilization and still paying a major  role in agricultural dependent economies. The dynamics of agricultural growth, employment and long  run sustainability depends on soil fertility and management. Soil fertility is one of the important factors  that determines the productivity and profitability of crops, cropping and farming systems. In simple  terms soil fertility is the ability of the soil to provide all essential nutrients required for plant growth in a  proper proportion. In order to achieve higher productivity and profitability, every farmer should realize  that fertility levels must be measured as these measurements can then be used to manage soil fertility in  terms of choosing appropriate cropping pattern and fertilizer use. As a part of baseline survey, a team of  scientists from ICAR-CRIDA collected soil samples and analysed them in ICAR-CRIDA soil test lab  and based on the results recommended the appropriate crops and crop rotations and also recommended  appropriate fertilizers and micro-nutrients for higher yields and profitability.  Currently the tools available for measuring the fertility levels of the fields are: a) Indigenous knowledge;  b) Plant/Tissue analysis; c) Visual diagnosis; d) Remote sensing; e) Soil testing/analysis; f) Greenhouse  pot experiments and; g) Biological tests, of all these tools, soil analysis is widely used for measuring  the fertility status of the soils as this technique is simple, rapid, cost-effective, accurate, universal, and  works for all kinds of soils.  Soil testing and its importance: Soil analysis is generally defined as any chemical, physical and  biological measurement that is made on the soil. Whereas, soil testing represents a programme that  includes soil sample collection, method of analysis, interpretation of results, evaluations, fertilizer and  amendment recommendations based on soil analysis and on several other considerations (Reddy, 2019;  Purakayastha et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2019). The objective of soil testing are to: a) accurately determine  the available nutrient status of soils; b) clearly indicate to the farmer the seriousness of any deficiency or  excess that may exist in terms of the various crops; d) express the results in such way that they permit an  economic evaluation of the suggested fertilizer recommendations and; e) to identify the type and degree  of soil-related constraints like acidity, salinity and alkalinity and to recommend the amount of lime or  gypsum to be added for reclaiming acid and sodic soils, respectively.  A sound soil-testing programme requires an enormous amount of  background research. This background  research should determine, the significant chemical forms of the available nutrients in the soils of the  area, the extractants most suitable for extracting all or part of the available nutrient forms, the relative  productive capacity of the soils of various crops, the differential response of the various rates and  methods of fertilizer applications for different crops, field sampling techniques, test procedures and  methodologies. The soundness of the required interpretive judgments will depend on the thoroughness  and quality of these background studies and it is aptly said that the success of soil testing is directly  proportional to its research backing.55 Soil fertility assessment in Kotapally mandal  Assessment of soil health and its management can help in enhancing the profitability of the resource- poor farmers of rainfed areas. Hence, efforts were made to assess the initial soil fertility status and also  to identify the soil related constraints affecting the crop production in Kotapally mandal of Mancherial  district, Telangana state under SCSP programme.  For assessing the soil fertility status 100 random soil samples from the farmer’s fields of three villages  viz., Mallampet, Nagampet and Eddagatta of Kotapally mandal were collected during March 2020.  The collected soil samples after air-drying were analyzed for major and micro-nutrients by following  standard methods. The results of the analysis of the soil samples are presented below: a) Organic carbon status: Analysis of the soil samples for organic carbon status revealed (Table 9.1)  that about 83 per cent of the soil samples in Mallampet are classified as low or deficient in available  nitrogen, whereas, in Nagampet and Edagatta about 64 and 55 per cent of the soils, respectively are  deficient in available nitrogen. It could also be seen that only 17 per cent of the samples in Mallampet  are classified either as medium or high in organic carbon status. Overall, about 70  per cent of the  samples in Kotapally mandal are classified as low in organic carbon status indicating that the soils of  the mandal are deficient in available nitrogen.  Table 9.1: Village wise soil health (soil organic carbon) status Village  Number/ percentage of soil samples testing under different category  for organic carbon status Low Medium High All Mallampet  34 (83) 4 (10) 3 (7) 41 (100) Nagampet  25 (64) 13 (33) 1 (3) 39 (100) Edagatta 11 (55) 6 (30) 3 (15) 20 (100) Overall 70 (70) 23 (23) 7 (7) 100 (100) Figures in the parentheses indicate per cent of samples  Available phosphorus status: Data in the Table 9.2 reveals that about 39, 51 and 45 per cent of the soil  samples tested for available phosphorus in Mallampet, Nagampet and Edagatta villages, respectively  were low /deficient in available phosphorus. Overall, about 45 per cent of the soils of three villages are  deficient in available phosphorus and about 55 per cent of the soils tested medium to high for available  phosphorus.

Only about 7 per cent of the soil samples in the three villages were low in  available potassium.  Table 9.3: Village wise available potassium status Village Number/ percentage of  soil samples testing under different category  for available potassium  Low Medium High All Mallampet  2 (5) 16 (39) 23 (56) 41 (100) Nagampet  3 (8) 14 (36) 22 (56) 39 (100) Edagatta 2 (10) 7 (35) 9 (45) 20 (100) Overall 7 (7) 37 (37) 54 (54) 100 (100) Note: Figures in the parentheses indicate per cent of samples  c) Available DTPA extractable micro-nutrients: The results of the soil analysis with respect to DTPA  extractable micro-nutrients such as iron, copper and manganese revealed that the soils of the three  villages can supply adequate quantities of these micro-nutrients (Table 9.4). However, with respect to  available zinc more than 90 per cent of the samples were deficient in available zinc.  Table 9.4: Village wise available zinc status Village Number of soil samples testing Deficient Adequate All Mallampet  34 (83) 7 (17) 41 (100) Nagampet  39 (100) 0 (0) 39 (100) Edagatta 17 (85) 3 (15) 20 (100) Overall 90 (90) 10 (10) 100 (100) Note: Figures in the parentheses indicate per cent of samples  Conclusion In general, Indian soils are deficient in soil organic carbon status, in line with the national soil conditions,  soils in the villages are low in soil carbon (70 per cent), and only 7 per cent of soil tests are indicated  high status. On the other hand, soil available phosphorus is moderate in general with only 45 per cent  of the samples with low status, 34 per cent medium and 21 per cent high status. When compared to  available phosphorus, available potassium was high in the soils, with 54 per cent reported high, 37 per  cent reported medium and only 7 per cent reported low. But the disturbing issue is most of the soils  (90 per cent) are deficient in micro-nutrient like zinc. Overall, based on the results, the farmers have to  focus on potassium deficiency in soils in addition to severe deficiency of zinc and soil carbon.57 References Joshi, P.

Narsimlu  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Managing water is vital for not only agriculture, but also animal husbandry and also for human  livelihoods. Importance of water management is still more important in predominantly rainfed areas  (Reddy et al., Hope, 2007). Godavari zone of Telangana (Adilabad district) has been classified as  Agro Ecological Sub Regions (7.3) and is characterised by semiarid climate with farming situation of  vertisols/alfisols and 1,150 mm precipitation and the major cropping pattern of cotton followed by rice  during kharif season and rice fallows during rabi. Agriculture is the major source of livelihood of the  people in this region. However, agricultural productivity in the region is very poor due to lack of water  resources during the terminal drought situation in spite of good annual average rainfall. Therefore,  the habitats of the region are one of the poorest farmers in India and mostly belongs scheduled caste  families. In view of this, the present study initiated with the following objectives.  In the study area, rainy season duration is four months from June to September with average rainfall  of 1,100 mm; this rain water needs to be stored used for crop production in the remaining months.  Hence, water conservation and harvesting and reusing are crucial for overall development of rainfed  areas. Kotapally mandal in the Mancherial district has Integrated Watershed Management Program  implemented by District Rural Development Authority (DRDA), Govt. of Telangana with the assistance  of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Govt. of India. The watershed consists of  several villages with focus on treatment of soil and water conservation measures.  The basic infrastructure developed in the watershed for water resource development were percolation  tanks in the farm of earthen dams constructed for rainwater harvesting in the farmer’s fields (Kerr, 2002;  Datta, 2015). Water harvesting structures like Percolation tanks and dug out ponds both as community  structures and on individual land holdings is a key intervention in most land and water conservation  program. Two types of soil, alfisols and vertisols are more prominent in dryland regions. The vertisols  having high clay content and higher water retention capacity causes low permeability and thus has  higher runoff potential. Whereas, alfisols is light textured soils which have low moisture holding  capacity but high water intake and thus has low runoff potential. Many watershed programs in this  region, mostly emphasized to increase the water table in the vicinity through activity involving surface  water harvesting and utilization. The water harvesting mostly achieved in small percolation tanks and  farm ponds, the harvested rainwater was recycled as lifesaving irrigation/supplemental irrigation to  attain sufficient soil moisture for successful crop production.59 According to Mohanty et al., 2014, under on farm research study, the water harvesting structures  were constructed in farmers’ field on a participatory basis in which farmers contributed to a part of  the expenditure. Multiple use of water was done from the water harvesting ponds to develop them as  integrated farming system models along with imparting adequate trainings and exposure visit to the  farmers. The results indicated that there was substantial improvement in the livelihood of the rainfed  farmers due to the technological interventions. Water harvesting is an ancient tradition and has been  used for millennia in most dry lands of the world; many different techniques have been developed.  However, the same techniques sometimes have different names in different (Oweis 2004). The on- farm runoff collection into farm ponds and recycling through supplemental irrigation can increase and  stabilize the crop production. There is an abundant scope and opportunity for harvesting excess runoff  in the rainfed region in different states of the country (Wani, et al., 2003, Sharma et al, 2009). About 400 (Percolation tanks) structures were created for water storage and use for irrigation to paddy  down word side of the structures. Since, the runoff potential is high with annual average rainfall of the  watershed is about 1,100 mm. The soils are medium to deep vertisols in 90 per cent of the watershed and  the rest sandy loam where horticulture crops are grown particularly mango. The study area in Kotapally  mandal has been delineated in to Kondampet watershed with a drainage area of 5,886 ha covering the  villages and part of Nagampet, Kondampet, Mallampet, Edagatta, Sarvaipet, Pinnaram and Shetpally. The flow direction varies from Northwest to Southeast, the elevation difference varies from 124-190  MSL, and major land use is crop lands, followed by forest and drylands. The soils are mainly vertisols  with ISDA class of Vp20-3a-3866 and the major slope is gentle topography (0-2 per cent). The thematic  maps of watershed, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Land use/Land cover( LULC), soils and slope  were shown in Figure 10.1.

The shale, limestone and sandstone of Penganga formations overlie granites/gneisses and  occur in north of Adilabad and Asifabad area and between Mancherial and Asifabad town. The Sullavai  formation comprising grits, conglomerates and sandstone rest over Penganga formations in Mancherial,  Sipur-Kagaznagar area. The Gondwana formations consisting of sandstone, which occupies the eastern  part of the district in Sirpur, Asifabad, Mancherial, Chennur and Yemanpalle area. The Deccan traps  are represented by both vesicular and massive basalt and occupy the central and western part of the  district. Sub recent alluvium consisting of laterite occurs as capping over Deccan traps in Utnoor Taluk.  Recent alluvium consisting of sand, silt and clay occur along the river courses. The Granite, gneiss,  schist, limestone, dolerite and basalt rocks are grouped under consolidated formation. The Gondwana  formations comprising sandstones, shales, limestones, etc., form a thick sequence of sediments and are  grouped under Semi-consolidated formations. The Unconsolidated formations consist of laterites and  recent alluvium [Central Ground Water Board (CGWD) report 2012-13]. Occurrence and movement of ground water Climate, distribution and intensity of rainfall, topography, geological formations, aquifer matrix such as  weathering, joints, fractures, fissures, bedding planes, recharge conditions, transmissivity and storage  conditions of the aquifers, etc., play an important role in occurrence and movement of ground water.  Hydrogeological map along with area recommended for artificial recharge of the district is in Figure.  10.2. Figure 10.2: Hydrogeology map of erstwhile Adilabad district, Kotapally mandal  shown in black circle62 But, the geology of some parts of villages viz., Nagampet, Edagatta, Kondampet and Mallampet of  watershed area is with lime stone layer to a depth of 1 to 2 m. Lime stone underlying the black soil will  have very low recharge potential due to low seepage rate and were shown in Figure10.1. Because of  these reasons, the bore wells are not functional but there is a scope for shallow open wells. However, the  farmers draw the water from percolation tanks/earthen dams through pipe outlet of 4 to 6” (10 to 15 cm  dia) for irrigating the paddy fields. The initial capacity of these structures varied from 800 to 3,500 m3  and silted over the years thus reducing the capacity of the structures by 20 per cent to 5 per cent. There  are about 50 per cent SC farmers having these structures in Kotapally mandal in different villages. Based on the discussion with farmers in the above villages, farmers constructed percolation tanks in 0.5  acre area to 1.0 acre area and sparing even half of the land holdings for water harvesting. This practice  of water harvesting was found even from their ancestors. The existing PTs were not in proper shape,  leaving a big hump in middle and there were no provision of spillways/waste weirs for disposal of  surplus water and several time the bunds were breached due lack of these waste weirs. Keeping in view  of groundwater recharges restrictions due to limestone layers and improper construction of PTs. It was  decided to rejuvenate the existing PTs into on farm reservoirs (OFRs), 18 PTs have been selected from  18 farmers for renovation of their existing PTs. The first set of 18 SC farmers of Nagampet, Mallampet and Edagatta were selected for rejuvenation of  these structure for desliting as well as for enhanced capacity ranging from 2,300 to 5,600 m3 capacity so  that cropping intensity could be increased under these structures along with enhanced water productivity.  The total expenditure incurred from SCSP budget was Rs.32 lakhs for rejuvenation of these earthen  dams with enhanced capacity. The farmers were trained on the rainwater harvesting and utilization  through sprinklers with irrigation pipes which were already distributed to SC farmers in the area. The  rejuvenation program was implemented in convergence with DRDA through MoU with Commissioner,  PR & RD, Govt. of Telangana. The list of the farmers is given in Table 10.1 and the pictures of the  structure before rejuvenation are given in Figure 10.3 to 10.6.

With the climate change the frequency of these weather aberrations is increasing (Amadu  et al., 2020; Blakeslee et al., 2020). The three study villages are also predominantly rainfed areas with  large area under rainfed cultivation. These villages were treated under watershed schemes since two- three decades, but the constructed check dams, farm ponds are not properly maintained. Under SCSP  program, the ICAR-CRIDA team in collaboration with DRDA Mancherial, Telangana Government  are planning to renovate these farm ponds for not only recharging the ground water but also to provide  supplementary irrigation to save crops during the dry spells. There is also a scope for second crop by  utilizing the residual moisture, and a chance to go for relay cropping in the impounded area of On Farm  Reservoirs (OFRs).  References Amadu, F.

Lavanya ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The yield, cost of cultivation and technologies adopted are important determinants of sustainability and  profitability of the farmers (Reddy, 2014). Technology adoption and profitability depends on various  factors including local agro-ecology, resource endowments, awareness, landholding size and irrigation  (Palanisami et al., 2015; Pandey and Diwan, 2021). Keeping in view this chapter assessed the above  aspects village wise, social groups wise and land class wise. In the study villages only two crops cotton  and paddy are major crops occupying more than 90 per cent of the area. Hence, this chapter covers all  aspects of technologies, input use, prices received and profitability of these two crops.  Adoption of technology is not uniform in these two crops. Even for the same crop, some technologies  are already reached saturation level, while some other technologies are not even reached 20-30 per cent  of the farmers. For example, use of fertilizers and pesticide is almost saturated among both cotton and  paddy farmers, while use of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and micro-nutrients have not yet reached even  20 per cent in cotton, while their adoption is just about 30-35 per cent in case of paddy. Only 34 per cent  of the cotton farmers are irrigating their crop, while it was about 60 per cent in case of paddy (Table  11.1).

One cotton seed bag contains 450 gm  in case of hybrids and 3 kg in case of varieties, while paddy seed bag contains 10 kg. Generally, one bag is recommended per  one acre in both cotton and paddy case. 1 bag Urea contain 45 kg, 1 bag DAP and MoP/complex fertilizers contain 50 kg each.67 This chapter is divided in to two sections dealing separately with the technological adoption in cotton  and paddy separately.  1) Cotton A) Cropping pattern The largest commercial crop in the entire Mancherial district is cotton. The cotton crop cultivation  detailing is presented in Table 11.2 to 11.4. Cotton crop is being cultivated on an average of 695.5 acres  of the land in three villages collectively, of which 310 acres of Nagampet, 255 acres of Mallampet and  129 acres of Edagatta are included. About 30 per cent of cotton cultivated land area is under irrigation  with an average yield of 9.7 quintals per acre which was sold at Rs. 4,997 per quintal, which comes to  gross return of Rs. 48,471 per acre. Although, there is a significant difference in irrigated area among  three villages (with Edagatta highest and Nagampet the lowest), the average yield and average price of  the produce is almost similar across the three villages.

Consequently, average yield among SC farmers  is less than the other farmers. The SC farmers are getting less gross revenue (Rs. 46,972 per acre)  compared to ST farmers (Rs. 59,541 per acre) and OBC farmers (Rs. 52,322 per acre). Average area under cotton was 6.17 acre among large farmers, while only 1.04 acre among marginal  farmers. Percentage of rainfed area was higher among large farmers and consequently yields are less  among them and also gross returns also less (only Rs. 30,906 per acre) compared to medium farmers  (Rs. 51,428 per acre).  Figure 11.1: Group farming by village youth (cotton) A few youths in the village taken about 40 acres on lease and cultivating cotton by pooling land and  other resources. Figures 11.1 and 11.2 are showing the Figures of these pooled land cultivation.  Figure 11.2: Cotton crop cultivation by youth69 B) Technology The Tables 11.5 and 11.6 and Figure 11.3 shows the technology adoption for growing cotton crop by  villages, social groups and land holding classes, respectively. On an average farmer used 2.03 bags  of seed per acre, with slightly higher seed rate in Mallampet. Urea (Nitrogenous) fertilizer is mostly  used by the farmers and on average they used 3.17 bags per acre, while use of DAP is 2.53 bags and  MoP/Complex fertilizers is only 2 bags per acre. The use of FYM and micro-nutrients is less than the  recommended level and also only few farmers practice it. On an average farmers irrigated crop just  1.29 times, as most of them cultivated the crop as rainfed. All the farmers harvested their crop (cotton  picking) by manually engaging mostly women labour both family and hired labour. SC farmers used  higher seed rate, urea and DAP compared to other farmers. An examination of technology adoption by  land class size shows that, small and medium farmers used more fertilizer compared to both marginal  and large farmers, indicating inverted “U” shaped relationship between fertilizer use and farm size.  Overall, the data indicate that farmers are using more nitrogenous fertilizers than the recommended, but  use of micro-nutrients and FYM is less than the recommended. The use of irrigation water is also less  than the recommended due to predominance of rainfed area.

Paddy crop cultivation  characteristics by villages, social group and farm sizes category are presented in Tables 11.7 to 11.9.  Being the kharif crop Paddy is taken up on a total area of 647.9 acres in three sample villages. In the  study area paddy was grown as irrigated crop, but mostly as rainfed crop and also based on stored water  in the farm ponds and other water harvesting structures. The average yields vary from 14.3 quintal  in Nagampet to 21 quintals in Edagatta. It is important to note that though Nagampet village was  having maximum area under paddy cultivation, its yields are less in the village. The average price  realization was ranging from Rs. 1,695 to 1,752 per quintal. Most of the paddy production is procured  through government at Minimum Support Price (MSP), hence there is no much price variation among  the villages. The gross returns per acre ranged from Rs. 25,055 to Rs. 35,601, which are comparatively  less than cotton.  Table 11.7: Paddy crop details by village (Kharif) Village Cropped  area (acre) Average  area (acre) Percentage of  rainfed area Average yield   (Per acre) Average  price (per q) Gross returns  (Rs./acre) Edagatta 108.8 1.04 91.0 21.0 1,695.3 35,601 Mallampet 167.4 1.07 63.3 15.1 1,718.4 25,948 Nagampet 371.7 1.53 61.9 14.3 1,752.1 25,055 Total 647.9 1.29 67.2 15.9 1,731.6 27,53271 The average paddy area per farmer in the village was 1.29 acre. On an average SC farmers grow  paddy on 1.27 acre, while area is little less among STs (0.92 acre), but more among BC (1.41 acre)  and FC farmers (6 acre). More area was under rainfed among SC farmers than other social groups. On  an average yields are lower among SC and ST farmers than OBC and FC farmers. The gross returns  are higher among FC (Rs. 30,400/acre) and lowest among ST (Rs. 23,983/acre). These figures shows  nearly similar findings as that of the national picture as per the recent cost of production statistics of  Government of India (Table 11.8).

This is mainly due to its less labour requirement compared to cotton. It is also more  mechanized friendly crop except in transplanting and weeding operations. Per cent rainfed area was  less among small and medium farmers compared to marginal and large farmers. Average yields are  little higher among large and medium farmers compared to marginal and small farmers. Hence, overall,  gross returns are better among large and medium farmers than small and marginal farmers. Overall,  it indicates that large farmers are preferring paddy, while marginal and small farmers prefer cotton  cultivation.

The seed rate (1.81 bags/acre) is little higher than the recommended practice by the  research station, with no significant difference between villages. Similar to cotton, overall, farmers are  using more fertilizers than the recommended doses especially nitrogenous fertilizers. On an average the  use of Urea (2.86 bags/acre) is higher than the DAP (2.26 bags/acre) and MoP/Complex fertilizers (1.79  bags/acre). At the same time use of micro-nutrients and FYM was less than the recommended dose. On  average number of irrigations given are 2.25 times during the crop season, ranging from 1.32 times in  Nagampet and 4.8 times in Edagatta. About 60 per cent of the farmers harvested their crop by using  manual labour, while remaining 40 per cent using through machine. But slowly farmers are moving to  mechanical harvesting. One of the reason for using the manual harvesting is, it is more convenient for  harvesting paddy straw which can be used for animal fodder.  The results shows that the fertilizer consumption (Urea, DAP and MoP/Complex fertilizers) and  mechanization of harvesting operations were directly proportional to the farm size in case of paddy,  while there is no significant influence of difference in case of other technologies. The technology  adoption across social groups in paddy shows that, SC farmers use less MoP/Complex fertilizers, a  smaller number of irrigations and also less mechanized compared to other farmers. Mechanization  was much higher in paddy harvesting among OBC famers than both SC and ST farmers. Harvesting  methods vary across socio-economic and land size category of farmers (Figure 11.4) even now farmers  are using indigenous traditional storage structures to store the harvested grain (Figure 11.5).

Being very remote and under-developed areas, the  level of farm mechanization is still low in the study villages. However, the mechanization is much  higher among large farmers (70 per cent) due to their large landholdings and intention to harness scale  economies. Mechanization of harvesting operations is still very low among marginal farmers (only 14  per cent).  Figure 11.6: Technology adoption in paddy and cotton cultivation In general, farmers are using more fertilizers in cotton cultivation than paddy, mainly farmers have  more expectations on returns from cotton crop, although it is with more price and yield risk. Farmers  spray more pesticides in cotton than paddy. However, in case of paddy they gave more number of  irrigations (Figure 11.6).75 References Palanisami, K., Haileslassie, A., Kakumanu, K.

Prasad and Jagati Yadagiri  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Horticultural crops are the future engine of growth for increasing farmer’s income. The demand growth  rates from both domestic and international markets especially fruits and vegetables and also plantation  crops are increasing at the rate of 5-7 per cent per annum while the growth rates of food grains and  other crops are stagnant (Kumar and Mittal, 1998; Joshi et al., 2004; Chand et al., 2008). Recognizing  this, both state and central governments are promoting the horticultural crops, wherever possible by  providing various kind of incentives like subsidized plant material, maintenance subsidy until gestation  period is over, drip and sprinkler irrigation systems etc. (Paroda and Kumar, 2000; Sharma et al,  2018). Mango production in India is 4.3 million MT as per NHB-2017, Uttar Pradesh stands first as  mango producing state. This is followed by Telangana (2.73 million MT), Karnataka (1.75 million  MT) and Bihar (1.36 million MT) (NHB, 2017). Mango is one of the major horticultural crops having  good demand in Telangana. Mancherial is the one of the Telangana largest mango producing district.  During 2019-20 in Mancherial district the area of mango is 17,927 acres, production 75,293.4 MT’s  and productivity is 4.2 MT/ha\\xa0(Horticulture department Telangana) and it is very less when compared  to national productivity average 9.7 MT/ha. In Mancherial mango orchards were planted without any  pattern and recommended spacing and also pruning of the trees was not practiced. Overcrowding results  in the production of fewer fruits which are apt to be poorly colored and infected with diseases. Tall trees  also present a harvesting problem and create difficulties during spraying and pruning. Nearly most of  the farmers did not supplement their trees with any form of fertilizer but some use organic fertilizers  such as compost and manure. However, the rates of fertilizer required for mango trees are not met in  these areas. Mango trees are usually left unfertilized once established. Regarding insect pests and their  management, the major insect pests were red ant, leaf webbing red ant, hopper, fruit fly, thrips and  termites while diseases included powdery mildew and anthracnose. Anthracnose is common during wet  weather and powdery mildew is common during hot weather season. The study team of ICAR-CRIDA  plans to provide information and other support services for adoption of better management practices  in mango orchards in the study villages, so that the farmers income can be increased significantly in  Figure 12.1  Figure 12.1: Causes of low productivity of Mango77 Impact of changing climate on mango productivity Climatic change and unseasonal rain regularly dampen the prospects of mango farmers in southern  India. Late flowering and delayed fruit maturity and the resultant delay in harvest gets mango caught  in rains leading to very poor quality of mango. On the other hand with the prevailing severe cold, dew  and fog during the nights and increasing temperatures during the day, the mango flowering is subjected  to damage. However, throughout the country the rain and hailstorm accompanied by strong winds are  another climatic factor severely damaging the yields of mango crop. The mango hoppers and the powdery  mildew are affecting mango flowers to a large extent and it is now a regular trend. Under favorable  season if the mango harvest is delayed till pre-monsoon period then there will be severe damage due to  fruit fly and stone weevil. Apart from this, mealy bugs and tearstains are showing an increasing trend  leading to very poor quality fruits. An aberration in weather shows severe staggered flowering leading  to irregular maturity time of fruits. Severity of the problem is such that even paclobutrasol applications  have failed to induce flowering. Recurrent flowering from January-April diverts assimilates towards the  new panicles depriving the developing fruits. About 18 insects and 14 fungal and bacterial pathogens do  cause appreciable economic losses to mango in different growing regions. What we can do: Mango crop can be brought to good production by doing pruning, proper irrigation  methods, manures and fertilizer application, plant protection and intercultural operations like weeding.  Pruning Mango trees are generally pruned to remove dead or diseased wood to allow more light to penetrate into  the leaf canopy and to control the overall tree height. About 25-30 per cent of moderate pruning is done  on commercially grown mango orchards to reduce the canopy height and width of large trees. Ideally,  the tree will be shaped to have three and not more than four main trunks, have ample interior canopy  space and is 12-15 feet (3.5-4.5 m.) tall. Moderate, and even severe pruning, will not damage the tree,  but it will reduce production for one to several seasons, though is worth it in the long run. Spreading  branches are more fruitful than erect branches, so pruning seeks to remove them. Lower branches are  also pruned to four feet from ground level to ease the tasks of weed removal, fertilizer application and  watering. The basic idea is to maintain a modest height and improve flowering, thus fruit set. Mango  trees do not need pruning every year (figure 12.2) Figure 12.2: A schematic view of light penetration in mango tree78 Irrigation Mango needs to be watered throughout the first two years of their life to supplement rainfall and  encourage growth. Each tree needs about 26 gallons of water per week. Once established, watering  is done only during the flowering and fruiting periods, usually December to increase the number of  flowers and keep formed flowers from dropping. Controlling the amounts of water before and during  flowering will help maximize fruit yields. Water harvesting technologies for supplemental irrigation Mango in rainfed areas faces water shortage during critical stages. Harvesting of rain water holds promise  to provide the much needed water at critical growth stages of mango and/or crops grown on orchard  floors. Several examples of success of rainwater harvest under mango systems have been reported. In  Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh), farm pond water is used for supplemental irrigation in mango (Kumar et al.,  2016). Similarly, in a one hectare model 35 year old Alphonso mango based farming system developed  at ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru under NICRA has shown that it is possible to harvest water received during  early monsoon period for irrigating intercrops during mid monsoon dry periods. Further the water  harvested from the rains received during receding South West monsoon and further during cyclones  during North East monsoon benefit the crops during post monsoon period (Manjunath et al., 2018).  In hot semi-arid areas of Karnataka micro-catchments constructed in half-moon shape (semi-circular)  across mango trees capture surface runoff. Such constructions have resulted in yield enhancement by  over 22 per cent (Ali et al. 2017). In HDP (5m x 5m) of Arka Neelachal Kesri in Eastern India, cup-and- plate system of rainwater harvesting and mulching with paddy straw has resulted in maximum increase  in fruit yield. Such several ways of rainwater harvested in mango orchards are in place in several  regions (Figure 12.3).  Figure 12.3: Half-moon shaped micro-catchment Pitcher irrigation: It is probably the poor farmers drip irrigation, but less expensive to install. The  pitchers are the round earthen containers used in rural areas for water storage, ranging from 10 to  20 liters in capacity. This is a highly efficient traditional method in which unglazed porous earthen  pots containing water are buried under the soil to provide controlled irrigation to plants. Water slowly  moves out through the wall to meet the plant’s water requirement. In certain cases, pitcher irrigation  may outperform drip irrigation in Water Use Efficiency (WUE). This kind of irrigation is ideal for  establishing orchards for saplings, promoting deep root growth and to supply water at critical stages of79 crops during drought. Soluble fertilizers can also be mixed with water and applied through the pitcher  as fertigation. It can also permit sustained use of saline irrigation water. Drip irrigation and fertigation:\\xa0Irrigation\\xa0to\\xa0mango crop is still under controversial situation in India.  Generally, it is taken for granted that mango tree does not require an irrigation and can survive on  rainfall (700 to 800 mm during June to September). However, irrigation to mango orchards has shown  the beneficial effect that the tree bears fruits earlier i.e., 6 year onwards the number of fruits and fruit  size is increased. Similarly the effective fertigation programme of giving NPK nutrition becomes easier  through drip irrigation. Management of drip irrigation is of prime importance in mango orchards. In  drip irrigation, the drippers operate at a slow rate; usually the discharge matches the soil infiltration  rate which neither allows surface flooding nor the runoff, making water losses minimal. Fertilizers and  nutrients are also applied through this system and their losses made minimal by localized application  and reduced percolation. Manures and fertilizer application  Fertilizers may be applied in two split doses, one half immediately after the harvesting of fruits in June/ July and the other half in October, in both young and old orchards followed by irrigation if there are  no rains. Foliar application of 3 per cent urea in sandy soils is recommended before flowering. Well  decomposed farm-yard manure may be applied every year. For trench application of fertilizers, 400g.  each of N and K2O and 200g.of P2O5 per plant should be provided. Micro-nutrients may be applied as  per the requirement in the form of foliar sprays. Integrated Nutrient Management The continuous use or excess supply of inorganic fertilizers as source of nutrient in imbalanced  proportion is a problem, causing economic inefficiency, damage to the environment and in certain  situations harm the trees themselves. INM involves maintenance or adjustment of tree nutrient supply  to an optimum level for sustaining the desired fruit productivity.  Plant protection measures Mango hoppers First spray of carbaryl at the time of panicle emergence and second spray two weeks after first spray.  Wettable sulphur @ 2 g/lit may be sprayed after spraying carbaryl to avoid mite resurgence. The mixture  toxaphene with Sulphur (1:1) have been reported to be effective against pest.\\xa0Neem oil 5 ml/lit of water  can be mixed with any insecticides. Spray 3 per cent neem oil or neem seed kernel extracts 5 per cent Red ant Nests should be removed and destroyed mechanically or by spraying any of the contact insecticides.  such as, Monocrotophos 2 ml/lit or DDPV 100 EC 1ml/lit\\xa0 Powdery mildew In order to\\xa0control powdery mildew, three sprays of fungicides are recommended. The first spray  comprising of wettable sulphur (0.2 per cent, i.e., 2 g per litre of water) should be done when the  panicles are 8-10 cm in size as a preventive spray.80 Figure 12.4: Mango orchards in Mallampet village of Kotapally mandal Figure 12.5: Leaf webbing by red ants Way Forward  Recent efforts in doubling of agricultural production have been successful through intensification  leading to increased yields per unit area. The potential for a further doubling in yields now attracts  increasing attention and research. There is need to revitalize yield growth in a sustainable manner  by reducing the inputs and using fewer resources. The current trend is to focus on ecological  intensification, sustainable intensification and evergreen revolution. Constraints are bound to occur  in the way including land and water, environmental degradation and climate change. A two way  schematic representation of how we must approach the issue of enhancing the productivity and yield  of mango without degrading the environment is presented in fig. 25 (Figure below). We must adopt  sub optimal tree and soil management practices to enhance the productivity and income of the farmers.  The challenge is how to apply good governance using existing agricultural sciences and technologies  without affecting the needed advances in tree productivity and yield. In this direction we must focus on  two main components. (i) the development of integrated soil orchard systems management, which will  address key constraints in existing tree management and; (ii) look for new ways that offer higher yields  but use less water, fertilizer or other inputs and insulate against drought, heat, submersion, and pests  and diseases. Conservation horticulture holds the key. Efforts must be made to create awareness among  mango farmers and popularize the concept of conservation horticulture to achieve the goal of enhanced  mango productivity.81 Application and extension of existing technologies Mango is national fruit and deserves a nationwide attention to achieve the top position in the world to  retain the title of national fruit and to help the farmers to make profit from mango orchards. Available  evidence suggests that the yield gap between average farm yields and the experiments yield on research  farms are derived from factors such as: (i) low profitability of mango production; (ii) limited access  to new orchard technologies and; (iii) poor soil and orchard management by farmers. We must focus  on a mission mode to adopt the available technologies of orchard management across the country to  enhance the productivity, yield and profitability of mango orchards and achieving the goal of doubling  the income of mango farmers (Figure 12.6) Figure 12.6: A two way schematic representation of approaches to enhance  the productivity and yield of mango.

Amarender Reddy and Jagati Yadagiri  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  India may be the world’s second largest producer of food, but it has its second largest undernourished  population. Further, more than half of women in India suffer from anemia, which is one of the reasons  for the high rate of low-birth weight babies. An unbalanced diet and lack of food is directly linked to  high rates of stunting, excessive weight, and death in children lesser than five years of age (Bhatta, et  al., 2008; Birdi and Shah, 2016). The Government of India has implemented programmes for providing  food security and ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food. There is a need to look at  multiple strategies to combat the issue of food security. Community and nutrition gardens can play  an important role in enhancing national food security and dietary diversity to combat malnutrition.  Fruits and vegetables from the kitchen gardens are good source of micro-nutrients especially in the  poor households. Rural areas have ample space and establishing a kitchen garden is far simpler as farm  families are involved in agriculture. Nutrition gardens are a micro-solution and an affordable way of ensuring healthy food and balanced  nutrition. Different studies on home gardens concludes it to be an effective and sustainable means  of improving nutritional standards of low-income rural families through integrated household food  production. Nutrition-gardening presents an innovative solution to ensure food security, employment of  youth, and an alternative way to generate extra income in developing countries.  In Mancherial district is carved out of erstwhile Adilabad district most of the rural villages lot of space  available for Nutrition gardens and some famlies are already involved in growing selected or few crops  like maize, gourds and beans. They are using only native seeds and one season for i.e., kharif for  growing vegetables in the backyard. There is lot of scope for diversification with different crops, seasons and improved seed for year around  production (Table 13.1 and Figure 13.1).83 Table 13.1: Crops suited for kitchen garden Fruits Vegetables Spices Medicinal plants Flowers Mango Banana Sapota Guava Papaya Acid lime Amla Pomegranate Anona Tomato Brinjal Chilli Onion Big onion Bhendi Bitter gourd Snake gourd Ribbed gourd Bottle gourd Amaranthus Lab lab Beetroot Radish Curry leaf Moringa Spinach Cluster bean Cowpea Tapioca Ash gourd Chilli Turmeric Coriander Fenugreek Ajwain Ginger  Aloe Mint Basil Tulsi Rose Marigold Jasmine Nerium Advantages of kitchen garden ► Supply fresh fruits and vegetables high in nutritive value ► Supply fruits and vegetables free from toxic chemicals ► Help to save expenditure on purchase of vegetables ► Vegetables harvested from home garden taste better than those purchased from market ► Effective utilization of kitchen waste water and kitchen waste materials ► Exercise to the body and mind Site selection ► Backyard of house ► Preferably open areas with plenty of sunlight near the water source84 Size and shape of vegetable garden depends on ► Availability of land ► Number of persons in family and ► Spare time available for its care ► Nearly five cents of land (200 m2) is sufficient to provide vegetables throughout year for a family  consisting of five members ► A rectangular garden is preferred than a square plot or a long strip of land Layout of kitchen garden ► Fence-barbed wire fence or live fence with agathi ► Perennial crops (Mango, Sapota, Acid lime, Amla, Morniga) should be planted at the peripheral  areas of kitchen garden (avoid shading) ► One or two compost pits may be provided on one corner ► Fences on all sides should be trained with cucurbitaceous vegetables (Bottle gourd, Bitter gourd and  Snake gourd) ► Some vegetables are direct sown-(Amaranthus, Bottle gourd, Bitter gourd and Snake gourd) ► Some vegetables are nursery transplanted (Tomato, Brinjal, Chillies and Onion) ► Divide the area into equal sized plots for raising annual vegetable crops ► As intensive and continuous cropping is done in a kitchen garden ► Fertility and texture of soil may be maintained by applying adequate quantities of organic manures  frequently ► Ridges and furrows are formed in each plots ► Season of planting: June-July and September-October ► Bee-hive may be provided for ensuring adequate pollination of crops besides obtaining honey ► However, in order to harvest good crop, chemical fertilizers are also essential ► Pick and destroy the larvae found on fruits and vegetables and then spray Neem oil @ 4 ml/liter of  water or Neem Seed Kernel Extract @ 3  per cent ► Avoid spraying of toxic chemicals85       Figure 13.1: Kitchen garden in villages of Kotapally mandal, Mancherial district References Bhatta, K.

Ramana and Prabhat Kumar Pankaj  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Livestock provides livelihood to two-third of rural community. It also provides employment to about  8.8 per cent of the population in India. India has vast livestock resources. Livestock sector contributes  4.11 per cent GDP and 25.6 per cent of total Agriculture GDP (Kumar et al., 2018: Vanam and Lakshmi,  2020). The livestock is especially important for providing regular source of income through dairy  animals, through sale of meat and chicken for small holder farmers (Ravichandran et al., 2020; Kumar  et al., 2020). However, productivity of Indian livestock is somewhat less than that of the world average  in milk and meat, etc. It might be due to low productive breeds, low quality sheds or feed and fodder  (Balehegn et al., 2020).  This chapter illustrates the population of various livestock by village, social group and land class  category and strategies for increasing incomes from the livestock. On an average, only 50 per cent of  the households own different types of livestock ranging from buffalo to poultry. About 47 per cent of the  households have bullocks, 25 per cent have poultry, 23 per cent have local cows, 20 per cent have young  cattle, 16 per cent have goats, 3 per cent have improved cows, 2 per cent have she-buffalo, about 1 per  cent have sheep, 0.79 per cent have he-buffalo and only 0.2 per cent have pigs (Figure 14.1).  Figure 14.1: Ownership of different types of livestock (in three villages together)87 Given that, only a few households have different types of livestock, in the following section, we are  presenting analysis of only households having animals. Analysis excludes the households who don’t  have animals.  Figure 14.2 illustrates the various types of livestock and their value. On average, households (averages  are calculated for households who have at least one animal in the respective category) in the study area  owned about 8 sheep, 5 goats, 3 male buffalo, 1-2 female buffalo, 2 bullocks and cows, 1-2 cross breed  cows and about 4 poultry. The livestock population in the villages are very diversified as they are used  for multiple purpose as draught animals, milk, meat, eggs, etc. In terms of value, bullock comes first  followed by female buffalo, goat, cross bred cows, sheep, local cows, male buffalo, young cattle, pigs  and poultry. It indicates, in the villages still draught animals play an important role in cultivation, hence  more number of bullocks.  Figure 14.2: Average number of livestock per household and their value  (Averages are calculated for the households having at least one animal in the respective category) Table 14.1 to 14.3 represents the livestock status in the study area by village, social group and landholding  class. The tables show the per cent of households possessing different type of livestock and average  number per household. On average, number of sheep are higher (about 7 to 8 per household), followed  by goat (4-5), poultry (3-4), male-buffalo (3), bullock (about 2), local cow and cross bred cow (1-2),  when we not take in to account households without livestock. Sheep rearing is done only in Mallampet  and Nagampet villages by scheduled caste and backward caste group villagers. Pigs are reared by only  one family who belongs to ST with marginal landholding in Nagampet village.88 Table 14.1: Pattern of farm livestock holding by village Village Edagatta Mallampet Nagampet All Livestock   (%) of hhs  owning  Average  per family  (nos.)

Female buffalos are being reared by SC, OBC and FC/OC household’s in Edagatta and  Mallampet villages. But the value of the breed reared by other caste group is almost double that of what  the SC household’s rear. Farmers of Edagatta and Nagampet village rear three male buffaloes by OBC  household’s only for breeding purpose. On average one to two bullocks are being raised by marginal,  small, medium and large farmers, albeit, the value of those raised by large farmers is greater than others.  In general, large farmers rear a greater number of bullocks and cows than small landholding farmers.  Landless and marginal farmers are rearing a greater number of sheep and goat relative to their land size.

Poultry, goats  and dairy farming is being taken up by the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward caste family  households. Value of goats, poultry birds and crossbred cows reared by the other-backward caste are  priced higher than those of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe. Although the count of livestock is  lower in case of large farmers as compared to others, they rear a greater number of large animals like  bullocks and cows and also cross bred cows. Goat farming is being taken up by the scheduled caste,  scheduled tribe and backward caste population of all the three village farmers across the land classes.  The major problem in livestock rearing is the majority are local bred with low yield potential (Figures  14.3 to 14.5). It is proposed that the improved breeds of goats and sheep as well as poultry to be  distributed under the SCSP along with distribution of seeds of improved fodder varieties for yearlong  availability of fodder.

Nagarjuna Kumar and Paladugu Praveen kumar ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Technological adoption is driving force for increasing agricultural production, productivity and farm  incomes (Kassie et al., 2011). Farmers are also looking to new technologies as a way to reduce cost  of cultivation (Subramanian and Qaim, 2009). Technological adoption also will have wider area  wise impacts in terms of better livelihoods opportunities, increased wage employment and food and  nutritional security (Ward and Singh, 2015). In this chapter, we have examined the overall adoption  level of technology in terms of improved seed, fertilizer consumption per unit area, use of micro- nutrients and pesticides and also irrigation application. Since, we have covered crop wise data in earlier  chapter, in this chapter we have taken farm holding as a unit and examined overall adoption of these  technologies rather than crop wise. It gives overall indication of adoption rate of different technologies  on a broader scale in areas, among different social groups of farmers and also land-class wise.  A) Technology adoption in crop cultivation Adoption of technology in terms of use and quantity of different types of inputs like fertilizers in the  crops per unit area in the sample villages were examined village wise, social group and also land-class  are presented in Table 15.1 and Figure 15.3 and 15.4. In the sample villages, average seed sown per  acre is 2 bags/acre. Generally, the recommended dose is only one bag, but farmers are using two bags.  Farmers of the village on average use 2.9 bags of Urea, 2.3 bags of DAP and 1.8 bags of MoP/complex  fertilizers. On average, they use about one cart of FYM, less than one packet of micro-nutrients per acre.  On average, they apply irrigation about two times and pesticides about 3 times per crop season. There is  no significant difference among the villages, except that in Edagatta use of Urea, complex fertilizers and  pesticides are higher might be due to a more number of irrigations given to crops (Figure 15.1), which  will provide suitable conditions to use more inputs. Being remote, the farm mechanization and labour  availability was good enough to meet peak season demands for cotton picking, etc.  Table 15.1: Technology adoption in crops by village (overall) Village Edagatta Mallampet Nagampet All Seed (bag/acre) 1.9 2.2 1.9 2.0  Urea (bags/acre) 3.2 3.2 2.7 2.9  DAP (bags/acre) 1.3 2.5 2.5 2.3 MoP/Complex fertilizers (bags/acre) 2.3 1.6 1.7 1.8  FYM (carts/acre) 0.1 0.6 1.6 1.0  Micronutrient (packets/acre) 0.0 0.5 1.5 0.8 Irrigation (nos) 5.3 1.4 1.2 2.1 Pesticides (nos) 3.7 2.8 2.5 2.9 Note: The recommended dose of seed rate is one bag/acre for both cotton and paddy. One cotton seed bag contains 450 gm in  case of hybrids and 3 kg in case of varieties, while paddy seed bag contains 10 kg. Generally, one bag is recommended per one  acre in both cotton and paddy case. 1 bag Urea contains 45 kg, 1 bag DAP and MoP/complex fertilizers contain 50 kg each.92 Figure 15.1: Monitoring of the ground water in a horticultural garden SC farmers are using more of Urea and DAP, but less of the MoP/complex fertilizers, FYM, micro- nutrients and number of irrigations compared to other social groups. The use of more Urea and DAP  and less of MoP/complex and micro-nutrients may be an indication of traditional cultivation and inertia  to use new and modern inputs. This inertia to change to modern inputs and varieties among socially  backward farmers is observed in many earlier studies (Gupta et al., 2020).  Figure 15.2: Technology adoption in crop cultivation by social group (all crops)93 Unlike social groups, technology adoption rate is having strong positive relationship with landholding  size up to medium landholding size, there after there was slight decline for large landholders, especially  in adoption of Urea, DAP and MoP/complex fertilizers. It shows that, marginal and small holders don’t  have enough purchasing power to purchase these inputs, hence there is a need for modifications. Figure 15.3: Use of farm inputs by farm size (all crops) B) Technology adoption in Livestock Production Management (LPM) On average, about 50 per cent of the households own different types of livestock. About 47 per cent  of the households have bullocks, 25 per cent have poultry, 23 per cent have local cows, 20 per cent  have young cattle, 16 per cent have goats, 3 per cent have improved cows, 2 per cent have she-buffalo,  about 1 per cent have sheep, he-buffalo and only 0.2 per cent have pigs. Whereas, on average, 14.5 per  cent of the households in villages are keeping their livestock in sheds and vaccination to the animals  was carried out by only 11 per cent of the households. Technology adoption in livestock rearing by the  households is highest in Mallampet village with vaccination at 32 per cent, where as in Nagamepet and  Edagatta vaccination rate is very poor.  Access to vaccination was again in direct positive relationship with landholding size (Figure 15.4)  with very low vaccination by landless (4 per cent of households done vaccination for their animals)  and highest among large households with 22 per cent of the households. Interestingly vaccination  rates for animals are significantly better among SC households than ST households. Only a few are  using concentrate mixture for their livestock, low use of concentrate feed is the greatest hindrance in  improving productivity of animals. Artificial insemination is not at all practiced in the sample villages  which are also reflected in dominance of local breeds with low milk yielding capacity.  C) Animal shelter management Overall, only 15 per cent of the households are having livestock sheds.  A significant number of large  farmers have animal shelters, while the majority of small farmers don’t. It indicates the majority of the  households keep their animals in open places or under the trees.  Scientifically constructed livestock  shelters are very important to manage micro-climate for the animal’s health, comfort and convenience.  The properly constructed animal shelters are also easy to maintain and clean, reduce drudgery for farm  workers. Hence the study team identified animal shelter construction and management is one of the  interventions for improving animal health and productivity in the study villages.94 Figure 15.4: Percentage of household’s in technology adoption in livestock Overall, adoption level of technologies was on higher side for crop cultivation, with saturation in  adoption of improved variety seed, fertilizer and pesticides uses. However, they are using more of  nitrogenous fertilizers and less of potash and other micro-nutrients. Although, there is good animal  population, use of FYM is also very limited. In case of livestock, they are still practicing age old animal  husbandry practices. They rear mostly local breeds with low milk yielding capacity (Basunathe et al.,  2010). The vaccination rate has recently increased, only a few are using concentrate feed mixtures to  feed animals, a few are having separate shed for animals. There is a need of increasing vaccination, use  of concentrates artificial insemination to increase productivity of livestock (Rathod et al., 2017).  References Basunathe, V. K., Sawarkar, S.

Lavanya ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Majority of the Indian farmers are small and marginal and lack of  necessary capital to invest in agriculture  (Reddy, 2012; Kumar, 2013; Ramprasad, 2019). Hence, availability of credit at low interest rates are  crucial for adoption of various inputs and also to meet daily consumption needs. The availability of  credit determines input use pattern, technology adoption, investments in land development, cost of  cultivation and farm incomes (Cole, 2009; Reddy et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2021). In general farmers  first preference is formal sources like commercial banks, Regional Rural banks (RRBs), cooperatives,  then from the semi-formal institutions like Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and last preference is informal  sources like friends and family, traders, input dealers and moneylenders as they charge higher interest  rates. Since years, farmers have been taking credit from different sources as they are unable to get  optimum income from the agricultural activities. The credit behavior of the households by village,  social group and land class are discussed in this chapter. Figure 16.1 presents the per cent of household’s accessed credit during the study year. About 86 per cent  of household’s have taken credit atleast from any one source. Share of households who accessed credit  is low in Mallampet (79 per cent of household’s) and highest in Nagampet (90 per cent), access to credit  is higher among OBC household’s (91 per cent), while less among ST household’s (72 per cent) and  among SC household’s it was 86 per cent. Access to credit was lower at 73 per cent among landless and  marginal farmers (84 per cent) than small farmers (93 per cent). Overall, the Figures indicated that SC/ ST household’s and landless labour had less access to credit compared to other household’s.  Figure 16.1: Percentage of household’s access to credit by village, social group and land class96 Figure 16.2: Sources of finance in the study villages Figure 16.2, indicates sources of credit and the main source of credit in the villages are RRBs (55.2  per cent of the household’s accessed credit) followed by SHGs (43.3 per cent) and friends and relatives  (26.8 per cent). Access from commercial banks, cooperatives, moneylenders, input dealers and traders  are very less. Overall, the findings indicate that farmers are accessing credit from low interest charging  sources like RRBs, SHGs and friends and relatives compared to higher interest charging sources like  moneylenders (Figure 16.2 and 16.3).  Figure 16.3: Number of sources of credit taken by household’s by village, social group and land  class Taking credit from multiple sources is increasing, because they may not be getting the required amount  from single source. Although only 86 per cent of household’s have access to credit some are having  access to credit from 2-3 sources. Figure 16.3 presents number of sources from which farmers accessed  credit. Overall, 43 per cent accessed credit from single source, while 36 per cent accessed from 2  sources and 7 per cent accessed from 3 sources. About 14 per cent ST household’s, 10 per cent of small  and 11 per cent of medium size landholding category farmers accessed credit from three sources. 52 per  cent of landless, 44 per cent medium and 42 per cent small landholding farmers accessed credit from  two sources. Overall, the data indicate that taking loans from multiple sources are problem for small and97 medium farmers as well as ST household’s for others problem is not serious.  Table 16.1 presents different sources of credit by village, social group and land class. Overall, 55 per  cent household’s have accessed credit through RRBs, 43 per cent from SHGs, 27 per cent from friends  and relatives, 6 per cent from commercial banks and very few are taken from cooperatives and money  lenders. Among villages, in Edagatta RRBs and SHGs are dominant sources, friends and relatives also  played important role in Nagampet and Mallampet. Commercial bank is major source in Mallampet  especially for SC farmers and also to medium and large farmers. So, commercial banks are playing  major role in disbursing credit to SC farmers under priority sector credit target, especially to meet the  needs of agricultural investments.  Table 16.1: Source of credit (percentage of household’s who taken credit from different agencies  by village, social group and land class) Category  Commercial bank RRB Cooperative SHG Money lender Input dealer Trader Friends &  relatives All  Village Edagatta 0 71 0 67 2 0 0 0 100 (105) Mallampet 15 42 1 46 4 0 1 16 100 (156) Nagampet 2 57 2 31 1 0 0 45 100 (243) Social  group SC 7 53 2 41 3 0 1 26 100 (374) ST 0 45 0 59 0 0 0 24 100 (29) OBC 0 66 1 47 1 0 0 32 100 (100) OC 0 100 0 100 0 0 0 0 100 (1) Land  class Landless 0 14 0 45 2 0 0 33 100 (113) Marginal 1 53 1 52 3 1 0 19 100 (79) Small 6 72 2 42 3 0 1 27 100 (124) Medium 9 69 2 37 2 0 1 27 100 (129) Large 12 71 2 44 2 0 0 25 100 (59) Total 6 55 1 43 2 0 0 27 100 (504) The Figures 16.4 to 16.6 shows the average outstanding credit among household’s who have taken  loans from different sources by village, social group and land class. The average outstanding credit was  highest at Rs.1,47,000 from money lenders in Nagampet, followed by Rs.1,27,000 from friends and  relatives again from Nagampet, Rs.1,11,000 from RRBs in Edagatta. Generally, loans from cooperatives  and SHGs are for smaller amounts between Rs.10,000 to Rs.60,000, whereas, from commercial banks,  RRBs, moneylenders and relatives are for larger amounts. Despite of having a high rate of interest the  money lenders remain a significant source of credit in all the three villages. It is also noted that, although  being a formal institution, the reach of cooperative societies and the commercial banks are very less,  which needs to be increased as they charge very less interest rates and also don’t follow extortion  methods for repayments. Many farmers are feeling that formal institutions are more of procedure bound  and more delay and less of customer friendly orientation, ask for many details and security, which may  force the farmers to rely on the informal money lenders even at higher interest rates. In our focus group  discussions, women expressed that SHG’s loans are life line for livelihoods and small businesses for  women (Figure 16.7).98 Figure 16.4: Outstanding credit of the household’s by village Figure 16.5: Source and amount of credit of the household’s by social group Figure 16.6: Outstanding credit of the household’s by land class category99    Figure 16.7: Interaction with SHG’s References Cole, S.

Amarender Reddy, C. A. Rama Rao and Y. L. Meghana  ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Agriculture is a highly risky economic activity because of its heavy dependence on weather conditions  which underscores the need for insurance (Reddy, 2004; Suresh et al., 2017). Insurance is not only an  investment to increase income; it also helps to cope with the risk and improving standard of living of  agricultural livelihood (Gulati et al., 2018; Aditya et al., 2018). But the close look of the data in the  Figures 17.1 to 17.3 revealed the fact that most of the household’s are deprived of accessing any of the  crop or weather insurance. The crop insurance scheme is not even reaching the ‘FC/OC’ group and large farmers unless it was  compulsory and linked to crop loans. But it was also noticed in the village wise comparison that there  is a better coverage of insurance in Edagatta village compared to other villages. Figure 17.1: Crop insurance by village (Percentage) Figure 17.2: Crop insurance by social group101 Figure 17.3: Crop insurance by land size class category Figure 17.4: Percentage of household’s citing reason for not taking insurance A majority of the sample household’s of the three villages across the socio-economic groups have  quoted that the reasons for not opting to crop insurance is, they never felt the need for insurance as  they are not aware of the crop insurance product (Figure 17.4). The next major reason is as they are  tenant farmers, they are not able to take crop insurance as they don’t have necessary documents, some  farmers expressed that they don’t have money to pay premium during the sowing season as they have to  purchase other urgent inputs like seed and fertilizer, some of the farmers expressed that their holdings  are too small to take crop insurance and benefit from it, some farmers also expressed that they never  heard about crop insurance, insurance facility is not available and due to lack necessary information.  Some farmers expressed that they don’t trust private company who issue policies at the village. It  is important to note that despite the overarching central schemes for crop insurance, 17 per cent of  Mallampet villagers, 8.3 per cent of scheduled caste and 5 to 10 per cent of small, medium and marginal  farmers don’t feel the need for crop insurance. The above results indicate that the main reason for not  taking crop insurance is lack of awareness, eligibility and lack of money for payment of premium.102 References Aditya, K.

Ramanjul Reddy ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  Food security Food security historically referred to the overall regional, national, or even global food supply and  shortfalls in supply compared to requirements. But, with increased observation of insufficient food  intake by certain groups (despite overall adequacy of food supply), the term has more recently been  applied mostly at a community, local, household or individual level (Weingärtner, 2009). Further, the  term has been broadened beyond notions of food supply to include elements of access, vulnerability,  and sustainability (Chambers 1989; Reddy, 2016). According to a currently accepted definition (FAO 2000), ‘Food Security’ is achieved when it is ensured  that “all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious  food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”. Food is here  defined as any substance that people eat and drink to maintain life and growth. As a result, safe and  clean water is an essential part of food commodities. The nutrition focus adds the aspects of caring practices and health services and healthy environments  to this definition and concept. This aims at what is more precisely called ‘Nutrition Security’, which  can be defined as adequate nutritional status in terms of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals for all  household members at all times (Quisumbing 1995). Now, after incorporating nutrition aspects “Food and nutrition security is achieved, if adequate food  (quantity, quality, safety, socio-cultural acceptability) is available and accessible for and satisfactorily  used and utilized by all individuals at all times to live a healthy and active life.” This definition combines  Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) and emphasizes several aspects, i.e., ‘Availability’, ‘Accessibility’,  and ‘Use and Utilization’ of food. The inclusion of the use and utilization aspect underscores the fact  that ‘Nutrition Security’ is more than ‘Food Security.’ Figure 18.1: Conceptual framework for food security Source: FAO (1996)104 Aspects of Food and nutrition security The conceptual framework of food security Figure 18.1, illustrates the relationship among the various  elements of food security. Two factors influence the framework: a physical and a temporal factor. The  physical determinant is the food flow: Availability, Accessibility, Use and Utilization. The temporal  determinant of FNS refers to stability, which affects all three physical elements.  In this context availability refers to the physical existence of food, be it from own production or on the  markets. On national level food availability is a combination of domestic food production, commercial  food imports, food aid, and domestic food stocks, as well as the underlying determinants of each of  these factors. Use of the term availability is often confusing, since it can refer to food supplies available  at both the household level and at a more aggregate (regional or national) level. However, the term is  applied most commonly in reference to food supplies at the regional or national level. Access is ensured when all household’s and all individuals within those household’s have sufficient  resources to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. It is dependent on the level of household  resources-capital, labour, and knowledge and on prices. Note that adequate access can be achieved  without households being self-sufficient in food production. More important is the ability of household’s  to generate sufficient income which, together with own production, can be used to meet food needs.  Food access also is a function of the physical environment, social environment and policy environment  which determine how effectively households are able to utilize their resources to meet their food security  objectives. Drastic changes in these conditions, such as during periods of drought or social conflict,  may seriously disrupt production strategies and threaten the food access of affected household’s. To  the extent that these shocks often lead to the loss of productive assets such as livestock, they also have  severe implications for the future productive potential of household’s and, therefore, their long-term  food security.  Use of food refers to the socio-economic aspect of household food security. If sufficient and nutritious  food is both available and accessible the household has to make decisions concerning what food is to  be purchased, prepared and consumed (demanded) and how the food is allocated within the household.  In household’s where distribution is unequal, even if the measured aggregate access is sufficient, some  individuals may suffer from food deficiency. The same is true if the composition of the consumed food  is unbalanced. Another aspect is the social function that food can have in terms of community cohesion  through offerings, ritual meals etc., especially in food deficit times. All these socio-economic aspects  are determined by knowledge and habits. This is especially critical for feeding infants (breast feeding,  weaning foods etc.). Focusing on the individual level food security also requires taking the biological utilization of food  into consideration. This refers to the ability of the human body to take food and convert it into either  energy which is either used to undertake daily activities or is stored. Utilization requires not only an  adequate diet, but also a healthy physical environment, including safe drinking water and adequate  sanitary facilities (so as to avoid disease) and an understanding of proper health care, food preparation,  and storage processes.  Stability or sustainability refers to the temporal dimension of nutrition security i.e., the time frame  over which food security is being considered. In much of the food security literature, a distinction  is made between chronic food insecurity-the inability to meet food needs on an ongoing basis-and105 transitory food insecurity when the inability to meet food needs is of a temporary nature (Maxwell  and Frankenberger 1992). Transitory food insecurity is sometimes divided into two subcategories: (i)  cyclical, where there is a regular pattern to food insecurity, e.g., the ‘lean season’ or ‘hungry season’  that occurs in the period just before harvest and; (ii) temporary, which is the result of a short-term,  exogenous shock such as droughts or floods.  Conceptual framework for malnutrition  Figure 18.2 shows the conceptual framework of malnutrition, developed by UNICEF and widely  accepted at the international level. It is mainly used in the context of under-nutrition in rural areas  of developing countries. According to this framework, malnutrition occurs as a result of a number of  factors which directly and indirectly cause malnutrition. The immediate causes of the nutritional status  manifest themselves at the level of the individual human being. These are dietary intake and health  status. These factors themselves are interdependent. Dietary intake must be adequate in quantity and  in quality, and nutrients must be consumed in appropriate combinations for the human body to be able  to absorb them (energy, protein, fat, and micro-nutrients). On household level the decision what food  is being put on the table (demand) and who is to eat it (intra-household distribution) determines the  composition of the meals for the individual. Habits (e.g. food taboos) and knowledge (e.g. preparation,  processing, child feeding practices) influence the composition but also the biological utilization of the  food. There are strong synergistic relationships between the health status and the nutritional status. A  poorly nourished person has a weakened immune system and is more prone to infections. Infections  increase the potential for and severity of malnutrition.  Figure 18.2: Conceptual framework for malnutrition (UNICEF, 1991)  as reported in Weingärtner (2009).106 Figure 18.3, depicts a simplified causal model of linking nutritional status with causal factors at  household level. In this conceptual framework, the nutritional status is an outcome of food intake and  health status. However, the underlying causes of health-environmental causes and health services-have  been depicted in different boxes due to their different natures. A reduced state of health may be due  in part to tenuous access to health care, poor housing and environmental conditions, and is possibly  worsened by malnutrition, which predispose individuals to diseases. The distinction between health  services and environment is necessary to select appropriate intervention strategies. Figure 18.3: Conceptual framework of the nutrition status at household level Source: Weingärtner, L. (2009) Application to local situation In this section, we try to apply the above concept to assess household food and nutritional security. We  have canvassed special questionnaire to understand the food consumption habits of the representative  household’s along with anthropometric indicators like height, weight etc.  The food availability in local conditions determined by the food production, purchases and government  schemes like Public Distribution System (PDS) for household’s. In addition to the above child and  women food and nutritional availability depends also on effective functioning of Anganwadi centers  and Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) centers. The Anganwadi center is a place where  parents feel safe leaving their kids to go to work, and it keeps unattended children off the streets. The  ICDS centers provide nutritional meals, preschool education, primary healthcare, immunization, health  check-up and referral services to children under 6 years of age and their mothers. Existing situation of food habits  Kotapally mandal is situated in Mancherial district which is predominantly agrarian society. The major  crops grown are cotton and paddy. There is a well-functioning ration shop deliver subsidised rice for  each below poverty household. Hence, availability of rice is not a problem for majority of household’s.  Many household’s directly involved in farming and mostly grow paddy and to some extent pulses and  other food items within their farms. So, they are not directly exposed to price uncertainty.107 Majority of the household’s maintain kitchen gardens in the villages. They grow leafy vegetables,  pigeon pea, beans, tomato, bhendi and brinjal for their household consumption. Some farmers are  also growing desi poultry, goat and sheep for the meat purpose mostly for household consumption.  Sometimes, surplus is marketed in the local weekly market to purchase other household items. Some  household’s are also maintaining dairy animals for milk purpose, they are also selling surplus milk  locally at reasonable price, the money received from milk is again used for purchasing farm inputs and  hiring agricultural labour.  The general food habits of the villagers are morning breakfast in which they consume mostly idli, dosa,  puri etc., along with tea or coffee. Afternoon they consume mainly rice along with at least one vegetable,  sometimes with pulses and sambhar. Pulses and green leafy vegetables were consumed weekly twice.  During the dinner again they consume rice along with vegetables and curd. Majority are not using  millets and other diversified foods. Consumption of fruits are infrequent, only a few household’s that  too weekly once or twice. On average, per capita consumption per month was 10 kg of rice, 1 kg of  pulses, 1.75 kg edible oils and 0.6 kg green leafy vegetables. On average, monthly once or twice they  eat chicken or meat, with about 0.6 kg per person per month. Milk was consumed daily, on average  2.43 liters per month per capita. Overall, it appears that the proportion of calories coming from cereals  like rice is much higher, while protein consumption was much less. Since most of the household’s are  having kitchen gardens, they consume significant amount of vegetables, which meet their fiber and  nutritional needs. Anthropometric indicators Average age of the head of the household is 48.8 years, with 5.24 feet height and 49.78 kg weight.  While among adult females, average age is 40.9 years, height is 4.9 feet and weight is 41.8 kg. Children  appeared to be undernourished, although they have Anganwadi and mid-day meal schemes intended  to provide nutritious food for at least once a day. The Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated as per the  standard formula (BMI = kg/m2) for sample household’s for both husband and wife to see the gender  differences. It is reported that in most of the household’s BMI is more or less similar for male and  female within the family, in some families female BMI is less than desirable. No one is in overweight  range (Figure 18.4).  Figure 18.4: Body Mass Index for male and female in the same family108 Problem analysis  The study team find out that there is a significant undernourishment especially among women and  children from both secondary sources and which were supported by primary data collection. A detailed  analysis of the problem was done by drawing fishbone diagram of problem analysis, diagnosis and  dissection (Figure 18.5). The major cause of undernourishment are poverty, irregular incomes, low crop  yields, unhealthy food habits like excessive proportion of rice compared to fruits and vegetables and  infectious diseases.

Narsimlu ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Santoshnagar,  Hyderabad- 500 059, Telangana State  The scheduled caste communities are most backward population in India. They are historically neglected  since centuries, to compensate this historical negligence, the Government of India (GoI) proactively  taking steps to increase their socio-economic status. Among the many programmes, SC-Sub Plan is one  with more concentrated efforts to increase farmers’ income. The strategy of SCSP consists of important  interventions through planning process for social, educational and economic development of Scheduled  Castes and also for improvement in their working and living conditions. Under the Scheduled Castes Development Bureau (SCDB), the Government of India is implementing  Schedules Caste Sub-Plan (SCSP) which is an umbrella strategy to ensure flow of targeted financial and  physical benefits from all the general sectors of development for the benefit of Scheduled Castes. Under  the strategy, each implementing agency is required to formulate and implement Special Component  Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes as part of their Annual Plans by earmarking resources. At present 27  States/UTs having sizeable SC population are implementing Schedules Caste Sub-Plan. Objective of the Scheme The main objective is to give a thrust to family-oriented schemes of economic development of SCs  below the poverty line, by providing resources for filling the critical gaps and for providing missing  vital inputs so that the schemes can be more meaningful. Since the schemes/programmes for SCs may be  depending upon the local occupational pattern and the economic activities available, the implementing  agencies have been given a reasonable flexibility in utilizing funds with the only condition that it should  be utilized benefit SC households. The implementing agencies have been given flexibility in choice of  activities to be implemented, within the overall framework of the scheme. Scheduled Castes Sub Plan  (SCSP) is a central scheme under which 100 per cent grant is given to the implementing agencies. ICAR-CRIDA is implementing the SC-Sub plan in Mancherial district of Telangana state with the  aim of doubling farmer’s income (DFI) within a five year period. A special focus has been given to  inclusive growth especially in empowering women farmers, educated unemployed youth through skill  development and entrepreneurship development.  Regular meetings are conducted to examine the feasibility and viability of the activities planned  for improving the farmer’s incomes. Regular field visits by scientist of  ICAR-CRIDA, Hyderabad  to examine the shortcomings/loopholes in implementation and taking corrective steps were planned  within the action plan. Identification of viable schemes as per the developmental needs of SCs and  identification of eligible beneficiaries to be considered for assistance in a financial year will be finalized  by the SC communities themselves which will be facilitated by the CRIDA team.110 The skill developing training programmes will be conducted with the support of other line departments  like NIRD, ICAR Institutes, etc., and formulated in such a way that after the completion of training, the  placement of trained candidates either in waged employment or in self-employment is ensured. Follow  up of the beneficiaries after the planned activities will be conducted to ascertain whether they have  acquired necessary assets and utilizing the assets for income generating activities. ICAR-CRIDA team  will do all efforts for ensuring full utilization of SC-Sub Plan funds and effective implementation of  scheme for the benefit of the target group. NRM based development activities Mancherial district has been classified as Agro Ecological Sub Regions (7.3) and is characterized  by semiarid climate with farming situation of vertisols/alfisols and 1150 mm precipitation and the  major cropping pattern of cotton followed by rice during kharif season and rice fallows during rabi.  However, agricultural productivity in the region is very poor due to lack of water resources during  the terminal drought situation in spite of good annual average rainfall. Water resources development  through rejuvenation of percolations tanks, proper shaping of PTs, desliting, application of silt on crop  lands and bunds of PTs. Micro irrigations systems (Drip, Sprinklers etc.,) for increasing the water  use efficiency. Introduction of multicropping system like cotton crop in catchment area, on bunds and  paddy in command area. Utilisation of residual moisture for rabi crops like bengal gram, safflower and  chickpea  etc., and relay cropping in water storage area of PTs with black gram, green gram and horse  gram and also introduction of aquaculture. On farm reservoirs based farming system for enhancing  livelihoods and income level of the farmers in this region. Activities prioritized and responsible organization  Based on the detailed focus group interactions and also interaction with key informants, the study  team prioritized the following interventions and also identified responsible institutions/organizations  for undertaking the activities in the study area (Table 19.1).

      "beneficiaries to be considered for assistance in a financial year will be finalized by the SC communities themselves which will be facilitated by the CRIDA team.110 The skill developing training programmes will be conducted with the support of other line departments like NIRD, ICAR Institutes, etc., and formulated in such a way that after the completion of training, the placement of trained candidates either in waged employment or in self-employment is ensured. Follow up of the beneficiaries after the planned activities will be conducted to ascertain whether they have acquired necessary assets and utilizing the assets for income generating activities. ICAR-CRIDA team will do all efforts for ensuring full utilization of SC-Sub Plan funds and effective implementa s faced by the SC households in these three villages to come out of poverty and plan, prioritize and implement household-oriented schemes for overall socio-economic development. ICAR- CRIDA will provide resources and technical support to fill the critical gaps and by providing vitaliv inputs to achieve the target of improved livelihoods, socio-economic development. Since the schemes/ programmes for SCs depends on the local occupational pattern, economic activities and resource endowments, the implementing agencies have been given flexibility in utilizing the funds with the only condition that it should be utilized in conjunction with SCSP and other resources available from various line departments like agricultural and rural development departments, various corpo fferent stakeholders in solving the prioritized problems. In the table, green colour indicates the strong capability of individual/organization to solve the problems in specific prioritized area, while red colour indicates weak capability, which needs to be improved through training programmes and skill development.5 Table 1.2: Capability matrix: strengths and weakness matrix of stakeholders Priority area Individuals/organizations/institutions Credit Individuals Cooperatives Commercial banks Money lenders Agricultural technology Farmers ICAR- CRIDA Department of agriculture KVK Kitchen garden Households ICAR- CRIDA Department of horticulture KVK Nutrition Households Aanganwadis Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) ICAR-CRIDA Soil health Faizabad-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kundalpur-Kund\n"
